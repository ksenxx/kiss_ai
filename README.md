## 🎯 The Problem with AI Agent Frameworks Today

Let's be honest. The AI agent ecosystem has become a jungle.

Every week brings a new framework promising to revolutionize how we build AI agents. They come loaded with abstractions on top of abstractions, configuration files that rival tax forms, and dependency trees that make `node_modules` look tidy. By the time you've figured out how to make your first tool call, you've already burned through half your patience and all your enthusiasm.

**What if there was another way?**

What if building AI agents could be as straightforward as the name suggests?

Enter **KISS** — the *Keep It Simple, Stupid* Agent Framework.

## 🚀 Your First Agent in 30 Seconds.

Try the interactive Jupyter notebook by running `uv run notebook --lab`.

Let me show you something beautiful:

```python
from kiss.core.kiss_agent import KISSAgent

def calculate(expression: str) -> str:
    """Evaluate a math expression."""
    return str(eval(expression))

agent = KISSAgent(name="Math Buddy")
result = agent.run(
    model_name="gemini-2.5-flash",
    prompt_template="Calculate: {question}",
    arguments={"question": "What is 15% of 847?"},
    tools=[calculate]
)
print(result)  # 127.05
```

That's a fully functional AI agent that uses tools. No annotations. No boilerplate. No ceremony. Just intent, directly expressed.

KISS uses **native function calling** from the LLM providers for efficiency and accuracy. Your Python functions become tools automatically. Type hints become schemas. Docstrings become descriptions. No crazy annotations. Everything just works.

## 🎬 Interactive Demo with Streaming Output

Run the built-in demo to see a KISSAgent solve arithmetic problems with real-time token streaming to both the terminal and a live browser UI:

```bash
uv run python -m kiss.demo.kiss_demo
```

This launches an agent that uses a `simple_calculator` tool to solve three math problems step by step. Output is streamed in real-time via the `Printer` system to:

- **Terminal** — using `ConsolePrinter` from `kiss.core.print_to_console` for rich-formatted output (tool call panels, result rules, final result panel)
- **Browser** — using `BrowserPrinter` from `kiss.core.print_to_browser` for a live dark-themed web UI with scrollable panels, syntax highlighting, and tool call cards

The demo uses the built-in `Printer` system. When `verbose=True` (the default), `KISSAgent` automatically creates a `MultiPrinter` based on config flags: `print_to_browser` (default: True) adds a `BrowserPrinter`, `print_to_console` (default: True) adds a `ConsolePrinter`, for real-time streaming to both the terminal and a live browser UI. You can also pass a custom `printer` parameter:

```python
from kiss.core.print_to_browser import BrowserPrinter
from kiss.core.print_to_console import ConsolePrinter
from kiss.core.printer import MultiPrinter
from kiss.core.kiss_agent import KISSAgent

browser_printer = BrowserPrinter()
browser_printer.start()
console_printer = ConsolePrinter()
printer = MultiPrinter([browser_printer, console_printer])

agent = KISSAgent("Arithmetic Demo Agent")
result = agent.run(
    model_name="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    prompt_template="Calculate 127 * 843, (1234 + 5678) / 2, and 2**10 - 1",
    tools=[simple_calculator],
    printer=printer,
)
```

See [`src/kiss/demo/kiss_demo.py`](src/kiss/demo/kiss_demo.py) for the full working example.

## 🤝 Multi-Agent Orchestration

Here's where KISS really shines — composing multiple agents into systems greater than the sum of their parts.

Since agents are just functions, you orchestrate them with plain Python. Here's a complete **research-to-article pipeline** with three agents:

```python
from kiss.core.kiss_agent import KISSAgent

# Agent 1: Research a topic
researcher = KISSAgent(name="Researcher")
research = researcher.run(
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    prompt_template="List 3 key facts about {topic}. Be concise.",
    arguments={"topic": "Python asyncio"},
    is_agentic=False  # Simple generation, no tools
)

# Agent 2: Write a draft using the research
writer = KISSAgent(name="Writer")
draft = writer.run(
    model_name="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    prompt_template="Write a 2-paragraph intro based on:\n{research}",
    arguments={"research": research},
    is_agentic=False
)

# Agent 3: Polish the draft
editor = KISSAgent(name="Editor")
final = editor.run(
    model_name="gemini-2.5-flash",
    prompt_template="Improve clarity and fix any errors:\n{draft}",
    arguments={"draft": draft},
    is_agentic=False
)

print(final)
```

**That's it.** Each agent can use a different model. Each agent saves its own trajectory. And you compose them with the most powerful orchestration tool ever invented: **regular Python code**.

No special orchestration framework needed. No message buses. No complex state machines. Just Python functions calling Python functions.

## 🧬 Using Agent Creator and Optimizer

📖 **For detailed Agent Creator and Optimizer documentation, see [Agent Creator and Optimizer README](src/kiss/agents/create_and_optimize_agent/README.md)**

The Agent Creator and Optimizer module provides tools to automatically evolve and optimize AI agents for **token efficiency**, **execution speed**, and **cost** using evolutionary algorithms with Pareto frontier maintenance.

**Key Component:**

- **AgentEvolver**: Maintains a population of agent variants and evolves them using mutation and crossover operations

It uses a **Pareto frontier** approach to track non-dominated solutions, optimizing for multiple objectives simultaneously without requiring a single combined metric.

```python
from kiss.agents.create_and_optimize_agent import AgentEvolver, create_progress_callback

evolver = AgentEvolver()

best_variant = evolver.evolve(
    task_description="Build a code analysis assistant that can parse and analyze large codebases",
    max_generations=10,
    max_frontier_size=6,
    mutation_probability=0.8,
    progress_callback=create_progress_callback(verbose=True),  # Optional progress tracking
)

print(f"Best agent: {best_variant.folder_path}")
print(f"Metrics: {best_variant.metrics}")
```

**Key Features:**

- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Optimizes for flexible metrics (e.g., success, token usage, execution time, cost)
- **Pareto Frontier Maintenance**: Keeps track of all non-dominated solutions
- **Evolutionary Operations**: Supports mutation (improving one variant) and crossover (combining ideas from two variants)
- **Uses RelentlessCodingAgent**: Leverages the relentless single-agent coding system with auto-continuation for agent improvement
- **Automatic Pruning**: Removes dominated variants to manage memory and storage
- **Lineage Tracking**: Records parent relationships and improvement history
- **Progress Callbacks**: Optional `progress_callback` for tracking optimization progress, building UIs, or logging
- **Configurable Parameters**: Extensive configuration options for generations, frontier size, thresholds, etc.

For usage examples, API reference, and configuration options, please see the [Agent Creator and Optimizer README](src/kiss/agents/create_and_optimize_agent/README.md).

## 💪 Using Relentless Coding Agent

For very long running coding tasks, use the `RelentlessCodingAgent`. The agent will work relentlessly to complete your task using a single-agent architecture with smart continuation:

```python
from kiss.agents.coding_agents.relentless_coding_agent import RelentlessCodingAgent

agent = RelentlessCodingAgent(name="Simple Coding Agent")

result = agent.run(
    prompt_template="""
        Create a Python script that reads a CSV file,
        filters rows where age > 18, and writes to a new file.
    """,
    model_name="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    work_dir="./workspace",
    max_steps=200,
    trials=200
)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Running with Docker:**

You can optionally run bash commands inside a Docker container for isolation:

```python
from kiss.agents.coding_agents.relentless_coding_agent import RelentlessCodingAgent

agent = RelentlessCodingAgent(name="Dockered Relentless Coding Agent")

result = agent.run(
    prompt_template="""
        Install numpy and create a script that generates 
        a random matrix and computes its determinant.
    """,
    docker_image="python:3.11-slim",  # Bash commands run in Docker
    max_steps=200,
    trials=2000
)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Key Features:**

- **Single-Agent with Auto-Continuation**: A single agent executes the task across multiple trials, automatically continuing where it left off via structured JSON progress tracking (💡 new idea)
- **Structured Progress Tracking**: Each trial reports completed and remaining tasks in JSON format (done/next items), which is deduplicated and passed to subsequent trials along with a scan of existing files in the work directory
- **Adaptive Step Thresholds**: Step limits per trial scale based on trial number and progress, with conservative early trials and more steps for trials showing good progress
- **Efficiency Rules**: Built-in prompt instructions enforce step minimization, batching, and immediate completion when tests pass
- **Output Truncation**: Long tool outputs are automatically truncated to keep context manageable
- **Retry with Context**: Failed trials automatically pass structured progress summaries and file listings to the next trial
- **Configurable Trials**: Set high trial counts (e.g., 200+) for truly relentless execution
- **Docker Support**: Optional isolated execution via Docker containers
- **Path Access Control**: Enforces read/write permissions on file system paths
- **Built-in Tools**: Bash, Read, and Edit tools for file operations
- **Budget & Token Tracking**: Automatic cost and token usage monitoring across all trials

## 🎨 Output Formatting

Unlike other agentic systems, you do not need to specify the output schema for the agent. Just create
a suitable "finish" function with parameters. The parameters could be treated as the top level keys
in a json format.

**Example: Custom Structured Output**

```python
from kiss.core.kiss_agent import KISSAgent

# Define a custom finish function with your desired output structure
def finish(
    sentiment: str,
    confidence: float,
    key_phrases: str,
    summary: str
) -> str:
    """
    Complete the analysis with structured results.
    
    Args:
        sentiment: The overall sentiment ('positive', 'negative', or 'neutral')
        confidence: Confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0
        key_phrases: Comma-separated list of key phrases found in the text
        summary: A brief summary of the analysis
    
    Returns:
        The formatted analysis result
    """
    ...

```

The agent will automatically use your custom `finish` function instead of the default one which returns its argument. The function's parameters define what information the agent must provide, and the docstring helps the LLM understand how to format each field.

## 📊 Trajectory Saving and Visualization

Agent trajectories are automatically saved to the artifacts directory (default: `artifacts/`). Each trajectory includes:

- Complete message history with token usage and budget information appended to each message
- Tool calls and results
- Configuration used
- Timestamps
- Budget and token usage statistics

### Visualizing Trajectories

The framework includes a web-based trajectory visualizer for viewing agent execution histories:

```bash
# Run the visualizer server
uv run python -m kiss.viz_trajectory.server artifacts

# Or with custom host/port
uv run python -m kiss.viz_trajectory.server artifacts --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5050
```

Then open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5050` to view the trajectories.

The visualizer provides:

- **Modern UI**: Dark theme with smooth animations
- **Sidebar Navigation**: List of all trajectories sorted by start time
- **Markdown Rendering**: Full markdown support for message content
- **Code Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks
- **Message Display**: Clean, organized view of agent conversations
- **Metadata Display**: Shows agent ID, model, steps, tokens, and budget information

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone/download KISS and navigate to the directory
cd kiss

# Create virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.13

# Install all dependencies (full installation)
uv sync

# (Optional) activate the venv for convenience (uv run works without activation)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Set up API keys (optional, for LLM providers)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export TOGETHER_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

### Selective Installation (Dependency Groups)

KISS supports selective installation via dependency groups for minimal footprints:

```bash
# Minimal core only (no model SDKs) - for custom integrations
uv sync --group core

# Core + specific provider support
uv sync --group claude    # Core + Anthropic Claude
uv sync --group openai    # Core + OpenAI Compatible Models
uv sync --group gemini    # Core + Google Gemini

# Claude Coding Agent (includes claude-agent-sdk)
uv sync --group claude-coding-agent

# Docker support (for running agents in isolated containers)
uv sync --group docker

# Evals dependencies (for running benchmarks)
uv sync --group evals

# Development tools (mypy, ruff, pytest, jupyter, etc.)
uv sync --group dev

# Combine multiple groups as needed
uv sync --group claude --group dev
```

**Dependency Group Contents:**

| Group | Description | Key Packages |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `core` | Minimal core module | pydantic, rich, requests, beautifulsoup4, playwright, flask |
| `claude` | Core + Anthropic | core + anthropic |
| `openai` | Core + OpenAI | core + openai |
| `gemini` | Core + Google | core + google-genai |
| `claude-coding-agent` | Claude Coding Agent | claude + claude-agent-sdk, uvicorn, starlette |
| `docker` | Docker integration | docker, types-docker |
| `evals` | Benchmark running | datasets, swebench, orjson, scipy, scikit-learn |
| `dev` | Development tools | mypy, ruff, pyright, pytest, jupyter, notebook |

> **Optional Dependencies:** All LLM provider SDKs (`openai`, `anthropic`, `google-genai`) are optional. You can import `kiss.core` and `kiss.agents` without installing all of them. When you try to use a model whose SDK is not installed, KISS raises a clear `KISSError` telling you which package to install. Similarly, the coding agents (`ClaudeCodingAgent`, `GeminiCliAgent`, `OpenAICodexAgent`) only require their respective SDKs — you won't get import errors for agents whose SDKs you haven't installed.

## 📚 KISSAgent API Reference

📖 **For detailed KISSAgent API documentation, see [API.md](API.md)**

## 🎯 Using GEPA for Prompt Optimization

KISS has a fresh implementation of GEPA with some improvements. GEPA (Genetic-Pareto) is a prompt optimization framework that uses natural language reflection to evolve prompts. It maintains an instance-level Pareto frontier of top-performing prompts and combines complementary lessons through structural merge. GEPA is based on the paper ["GEPA: Reflective Prompt Evolution Can Outperform Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19457).

📖 **For detailed GEPA documentation, see [GEPA README](src/kiss/agents/gepa/README.md)**

## 🧪 Using KISSEvolve for Algorithm Discovery

KISSEvolve is an evolutionary algorithm discovery framework that uses LLM-guided mutation and crossover to evolve code variants. It supports advanced features including island-based evolution, novelty rejection sampling, and multiple parent sampling methods.

For usage examples, API reference, and configuration options, please see the [KISSEvolve README](src/kiss/agents/kiss_evolve/README.md).

📖 **For detailed KISSEvolve documentation, see [KISSEvolve README](src/kiss/agents/kiss_evolve/README.md)**

## 🔄 Using Self-Evolving Multi-Agent

The Self-Evolving Multi-Agent is an advanced coding agent with planning, error recovery, dynamic tool creation, and the ability to evolve itself for better efficiency and accuracy using KISSEvolve.

📖 **For detailed Self-Evolving Multi-Agent documentation, see [Self-Evolving Multi-Agent README](src/kiss/agents/self_evolving_multi_agent/README.md)**

```python
from kiss.agents.self_evolving_multi_agent import SelfEvolvingMultiAgent

# Create and run the agent
agent = SelfEvolvingMultiAgent()
result = agent.run("""
    Create a Python script that:
    1. Generates the first 20 Fibonacci numbers
    2. Saves them to a file called 'fibonacci.txt'
    3. Reads the file back and prints the sum
""")
print(result)

# Access execution statistics
stats = agent.get_stats()
print(f"Completed todos: {stats['completed']}/{stats['total_todos']}")
print(f"Dynamic tools created: {stats['dynamic_tools']}")
```

**Key Features:**

- **Planning & Task Tracking**: Creates and manages a todo list with status tracking (pending → in_progress → completed/failed)
- **Sub-Agent Delegation**: Spawns focused sub-agents for individual task execution
- **Dynamic Tool Creation**: Creates reusable tools at runtime when prompted by the orchestrator
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry logic with configurable max retries
- **Docker Isolation**: Runs code execution in isolated Docker containers
- **Self-Evolution**: Uses KISSEvolve to optimize for efficiency and accuracy

**Evolving the Agent:**

```python
from kiss.agents.self_evolving_multi_agent.agent_evolver import AgentEvolver

# Create evolver
evolver = AgentEvolver(
    package_name="kiss.agents.self_evolving_multi_agent",
    agent_file_path="multi_agent.py",
    model_name="gemini-3-flash-preview",
    focus_on_efficiency=True,
)

# Run baseline evaluation first
baseline = evolver.run_baseline_evaluation()
print(f"Baseline fitness: {baseline['fitness']:.4f}")

# Evolve the agent
best = evolver.evolve()
print(f"Evolved fitness: {best.fitness:.4f}")

# Save the best variant
evolver.save_best(best)
```

## 💻 Using KISS Coding Agent

The KISS Coding Agent is a multi-agent system with orchestration and sub-agents using KISSAgent. It efficiently breaks down complex coding tasks into manageable sub-tasks and includes automatic prompt refinement on failures:

```python
from kiss.agents.coding_agents import KISSCodingAgent

# Create agent with a name
agent = KISSCodingAgent(name="My Coding Agent")

# Run a coding task with path restrictions
result = agent.run(
    prompt_template="""
        Write, test, and optimize a fibonacci function in Python
        that is efficient and correct.
    """,
    orchestrator_model_name="claude-opus-4-6",  # Model for orchestration and execution
    subtasker_model_name="claude-opus-4-6",  # Model for subtask generation and execution
    refiner_model_name="claude-sonnet-4-5",  # Model for prompt refinement on failures
    readable_paths=["src/"],  # Allowed read paths (relative to base_dir)
    writable_paths=["output/"],  # Allowed write paths (relative to base_dir)
    base_dir=".",  # Base working directory (project root)
    max_steps=100,  # Maximum steps per agent
    trials=3  # Number of retry attempts
)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Key Features:**

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Orchestrator delegates to executor agents for specific sub-tasks
- **Prompt Refinement**: Automatically refines prompts when tasks fail using trajectory analysis (KISSCodingAgent)
- **Efficient Orchestration**: Manages execution through smart task delegation
- **Bash Command Parsing**: Automatically extracts readable/writable directories from bash commands using `parse_bash_command_paths()`
- **Path Access Control**: Enforces read/write permissions on file system paths before command execution
- **Docker Support**: Optional Docker container execution via the `docker_image` parameter for isolated bash command execution

## 🧠 Using Claude Coding Agent

> **Requires:** `claude-agent-sdk` and `anthropic` packages. Install with `uv sync --group claude-coding-agent`.

Since everyone loves Claude Code, I thought I will provide API access to Claude Code so that you can use the best coding agent.
The Claude Coding Agent uses the Claude Agent SDK to generate tested Python programs with file system access controls:

```python
from kiss.agents.coding_agents import ClaudeCodingAgent

# Create agent with a name
agent = ClaudeCodingAgent(name="My Coding Agent")

# Run a coding task with path restrictions
result = agent.run(
    model_name="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    prompt_template="""
        Write, test, and optimize a fibonacci function in Python
        that is efficient and correct.
    """,
    readable_paths=["src/"],  # Allowed read paths (relative to base_dir)
    writable_paths=["output/"],  # Allowed write paths (relative to base_dir)
    base_dir="."  # Base working directory (project root)
)
if result:
    print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Browser Streaming Output:**

The Claude Coding Agent supports real-time browser streaming. When `use_browser=True` is set, a local server is started and a browser window opens automatically to display live output with a modern dark-themed UI:

```python
from kiss.agents.coding_agents import ClaudeCodingAgent

agent = ClaudeCodingAgent(name="My Agent")
result = agent.run(
    model_name="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    prompt_template="Write a fibonacci function with tests",
    use_browser=True,
)
```

When running `claude_coding_agent.py` directly, browser output is enabled by default:

```bash
uv run python -m kiss.agents.coding_agents.claude_coding_agent
```

The browser interface features scrollable panels for thinking blocks, text output, tool calls with syntax highlighting, tool results, and a final result summary with cost/token stats.

**Key Features:**

- **Real-time Streaming**: Uses `include_partial_messages` for live streaming of assistant text, thinking, and tool calls as they happen
- **Extended Thinking**: Supports Claude's extended thinking with configurable `max_thinking_tokens` for improved reasoning
- **Rich Console Output**: Uses `ConsolePrinter` from `kiss.core.print_to_console` for formatted terminal output with syntax-highlighted tool calls, thinking blocks, and result panels
- **Browser Streaming Output**: Uses `BrowserPrinter` from `kiss.core.print_to_browser` with uvicorn/starlette SSE server for real-time browser display with modern UI, scrollable panels, and syntax highlighting
- **Path Access Control**: Enforces read/write permissions on file system paths
- **Budget & Token Tracking**: Automatic cost and token usage monitoring

**Built-in Tools Available:**

- `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`: File operations
- `Glob`, `Grep`: File search and content search
- `Bash`: Shell command execution
- `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`: Web access

## 🤖 Using Gemini CLI Agent

> **Requires:** `google-adk` and `google-genai` packages. Install with `uv sync --group gemini`.

The Gemini CLI Agent uses the Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) to generate tested Python programs:

```python
from kiss.agents.coding_agents import GeminiCliAgent

# Create agent with a name (must be a valid identifier - use underscores, not hyphens)
agent = GeminiCliAgent(name="my_coding_agent")

result = agent.run(
    model_name="gemini-3-pro-preview",
    prompt_template="Write a fibonacci function with tests",
    readable_paths=["src/"],
    writable_paths=["output/"],
    base_dir="."
)
if result:
    print(f"Result: {result}")
```

## 🌐 Using OpenAI Codex Agent

> **Requires:** `openai-agents` package. Install with `uv sync --group openai`.

The OpenAI Codex Agent uses the OpenAI Agents SDK to generate tested Python programs:

```python
from kiss.agents.coding_agents import OpenAICodexAgent

agent = OpenAICodexAgent(name="My Coding Agent")

result = agent.run(
    model_name="gpt-5.3-codex",
    prompt_template="Write a fibonacci function with tests",
    readable_paths=["src/"],
    writable_paths=["output/"],
    base_dir="."
)
if result:
    print(f"Result: {result}")
```

## 🔍 Using SimpleRAG for Retrieval-Augmented Generation

SimpleRAG provides a lightweight RAG system with in-memory vector storage and similarity search:

> **Note**: SimpleRAG requires a model with embedding support. Currently, OpenAI, Together AI, and Gemini models support embeddings. Anthropic models do not provide embedding APIs.

```python
from kiss.rag import SimpleRAG

# Initialize RAG system with a model name that supports embeddings
rag = SimpleRAG(model_name="gpt-4o", metric="cosine")  # or "l2" for L2 distance

# Add documents
documents = [
    {

## ⚡ Multiprocessing

KISS provides utilities for parallel execution of Python functions using multiprocessing. This is useful for running multiple independent tasks concurrently to maximize CPU utilization.

### Basic Usage

```python
from kiss.multiprocessing import run_functions_in_parallel

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

# Define tasks as (function, arguments) tuples
tasks = [(add, [1, 2]), (multiply, [3, 4])]
results = run_functions_in_parallel(tasks)
print(results)  # [3, 12]
```

### With Keyword Arguments

```python
from kiss.multiprocessing import run_functions_in_parallel_with_kwargs

def greet(name, title="Mr."):
    return f"Hello, {title} {name}!"

functions = [greet, greet]
args_list = [["Alice"], ["Bob"]]
kwargs_list = [{"title": "Dr."}, {}]

results = run_functions_in_parallel_with_kwargs(functions, args_list, kwargs_list)
print(results)  # ["Hello, Dr. Alice!", "Hello, Mr. Bob!"]
```

### 💻 Checking Available Cores

```python
from kiss.multiprocessing import get_available_cores

num_cores = get_available_cores()
print(f"Available CPU cores: {num_cores}")
```

The multiprocessing utilities automatically scale to the number of available CPU cores, using at most as many workers as there are tasks to avoid unnecessary overhead.

## 🐳 Docker Manager

KISS provides a `DockerManager` class for managing Docker containers and executing commands inside them. This is useful for running code in isolated environments, testing with specific dependencies, or working with SWE-bench tasks.

### Basic Usage

```python
from kiss.docker import DockerManager

# Create a Docker manager for an Ubuntu container
with DockerManager(image_name="ubuntu", tag="22.04", workdir="/app") as docker:
    # Run commands inside the container
    output = docker.run_bash_command("echo 'Hello from Docker!'", "Print greeting")
    print(output)
    
    output = docker.run_bash_command("python3 --version", "Check Python version")
    print(output)
```

### Manual Lifecycle Management

```python
from kiss.docker import DockerManager

docker = DockerManager(image_name="python", tag="3.11", workdir="/workspace")
docker.open()  # Pull image and start container

try:
    output = docker.run_bash_command("pip install numpy", "Install numpy")
    output = docker.run_bash_command("python -c 'import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)'", "Check numpy")
    print(output)
finally:
    docker.close()  # Stop and remove container
```

### Port Mapping

```python
from kiss.docker import DockerManager

# Map container port 8080 to host port 8080
with DockerManager(image_name="nginx", ports={80: 8080}) as docker:
    # Start a web server
    docker.run_bash_command("nginx", "Start nginx")
    
    # Get the actual host port (useful when Docker assigns a random port)
    host_port = docker.get_host_port(80)
    print(f"Server available at http://localhost:{host_port}")
```

### Configuration Options

- `image_name`: Docker image name (e.g., 'ubuntu', 'python:3.11')
- `tag`: Image tag/version (default: 'latest')
- `workdir`: Working directory inside the container (default: '/')
- `mount_shared_volume`: Whether to mount a shared volume for file transfer (default: True)
- `ports`: Port mapping from container to host (e.g., `{8080: 8080}`)

The Docker manager automatically handles image pulling, container lifecycle, and cleanup of temporary directories.

## 🏷️ Versioning

The project uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). The version is defined in a single source of truth:

- **Version file**: `src/kiss/_version.py` - Edit this file to update the version
- **Package access**: `kiss.__version__` - Access the version programmatically
- **Build system**: `pyproject.toml` automatically reads the version from `_version.py` using dynamic versioning

Example:

```python
from kiss import __version__
print(f"KISS version: {__version__}")
```

To update the version, simply edit `src/kiss/_version.py`:

```python
__version__ = "0.2.0"  # Update to new version
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

**Embedding Models** (for RAG and semantic search):

- **OpenAI**: text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-3-large, text-embedding-ada-002
- **Google**: text-embedding-004, gemini-embedding-001
- **Together AI**: BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5, BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5, m2-bert-80M-32k-retrieval, multilingual-e5-large-instruct, gte-modernbert-base

Each model in `MODEL_INFO` includes capability flags:

- `is_function_calling_supported`: Whether the model reliably supports tool/function calling
- `is_generation_supported`: Whether the model supports text generation
- `is_embedding_supported`: Whether the model is an embedding model

> **Note**: Additional models can be used, but context length, pricing, and capability information must be added to `src/kiss/core/models/model_info.py` for accurate token tracking, budget monitoring, and test filtering.

Token counts are extracted directly from API responses, ensuring accuracy and supporting multiple agents sharing the same model instance.

### Embedding Support

The framework provides embedding generation capabilities through the `get_embedding()` method on model instances:

- **OpenAI Models**: Full embedding support via OpenAI's embeddings API
  - Default model: `text-embedding-3-small` (can be customized)
  - Usage: `model.get_embedding(text, embedding_model="text-embedding-3-small")`
- **Together AI Models**: Full embedding support via Together AI's embeddings API
  - Default model: `togethercomputer/m2-bert-80M-32k-retrieval` (can be customized)
  - Usage: `model.get_embedding(text, embedding_model="togethercomputer/m2-bert-80M-32k-retrieval")`
- **Gemini Models**: Full embedding support via Google's embedding API
  - Default model: `text-embedding-004` (can be customized; `gemini-embedding-001` also available)
  - Usage: `model.get_embedding(text, embedding_model="text-embedding-004")`
- **Anthropic Models**: Embeddings not supported (raises `NotImplementedError`)

Embeddings are primarily used by the `SimpleRAG` system for document retrieval. When using `SimpleRAG`, ensure you use an OpenAI, Together AI, or Gemini model that supports embeddings.
