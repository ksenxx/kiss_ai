"""Regression test: the "KISS Sorcar: Setting up" progress notification
must stay visible from the start of the dependency install until the
"Restart VS Code" notification is shown.

Previously, ``vscode.window.withProgress`` ran ONLY around the
dependency installation (uv, git, node, code-cli, python env,
playwright) and CLOSED before the post-install finalization steps:

  - ``installCliScript`` — write the ``sorcar`` wrapper
  - ``restartKissWebDaemon`` — kick the kiss-web daemon
  - ``ensurePathInShellRc`` — persist PATH entries
  - ``ensureApiKeys`` — prompt for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / OPENAI_API_KEY
    when neither Claude CLI nor any key is set

This created a visible UX gap: the "Installing dependencies..." toast
disappeared, the user saw NO notification for several seconds (or
much longer if ``ensureApiKeys`` resolved without prompting), and
then the "Restart VS Code" toast finally appeared.

The fix is to run those finalization steps INSIDE the same
``withProgress`` callback so the notification stays open continuously.
This static-source test verifies it.

The test pattern (regex on the TypeScript source) mirrors the
companion test ``test_restart_notification_sticky.py`` so a future
refactor that re-introduces the gap is caught immediately.
