"""Synchronous client for running tasks on the ``kiss-web`` daemon.

This module is the client half of the daemon's Python API: it speaks
the daemon's JSON command protocol over its local WSS endpoint (found
through the endpoint file, see :mod:`kiss.agents.sorcar.local_endpoint`)
and blocks until the submitted task finishes.  It lives in the
sorcar layer — not in ``kiss.server`` — because sorcar-layer code
(the ``run_agent`` dispatch tool in
:mod:`kiss.agents.sorcar.agent_dispatch` and the cron scheduler in
:mod:`kiss.agents.sorcar.cron_agent`) submits tasks back to the
daemon, and the layering invariant forbids sorcar code from importing
``kiss.server`` (see ``kiss.tests.agents.sorcar.test_layering_invariants``).
The public API surface is unchanged: :mod:`kiss.server.sorcar`
re-exports :func:`run` and :class:`TaskResult`, so
``kiss.server.sorcar.run(...)`` keeps working for external callers.

Depends only on ``websockets`` and the sorcar/core layers.

caller would report the task stopped while it might still be running

            tab in the daemon's shared tab registry (``scopeWorkDir``),

            CALLING task, when this run is dispatched on behalf of one
            (the ``run_agent`` tool).  Non-empty marks the run as a
            SUB-AGENT of that task, giving its tab the same frontend
            behavior as a ``run_parallel`` sub-task: no top-level tab
            of its own — instead every client viewing the parent gets
            a nested sub-agent tab (via the run's ``new_tab``
            broadcast), the run's history row nests under the parent
            task, and a ``subagentDone`` broadcast stops the tab's
            running indicator when the run ends.  Empty (the default)
            runs as an ordinary top-level task.  It is a
            client/UI-transport parameter with no SEA
            setting: a dispatched script must not be able to re-parent
            itself under an unrelated task.
        parent_tab_id: Frontend tab id of the calling task's tab,
            forwarded on the sub-agent's ``new_tab`` broadcast so the
            webview knows which tab spawned it (nested placement and
            cascade-close).  Only meaningful with *parent_task_id*;
            empty spawns a parentless sub-agent tab, exactly like a
            headless ``run_parallel`` fan-out.  No SEA setting.
        parent_reviewer: Whether the dispatched run belongs to a
            reviewer's sub-tree — the caller is a reviewer sub-agent,
            or *prompt* itself is a review task (see
            :mod:`kiss.agents.sorcar.fanout_guard`).  Stamped on the
            child's ``_subagent_info`` so it and its helpers keep the
            read-only ``review`` tool profile.  Only meaningful with
            *parent_task_id*; no SEA setting, for the same
            reason as *parent_task_id*.
        side_channel: Whether the run is a side channel of the parent
            — a sub-agent whose result is delivered into the PARENT's
            transcript (the ``/ask`` answer panel), so its own nested
            tab is scaffolding that is closed when the run ends and
            never re-opened by a replay.  Persisted on the child's
            history row; only meaningful with *parent_task_id*; no
            SEA setting.
        model: Model name; the daemon's selected default when empty.
        chat_id: Optional existing chat session id to continue.  Pass
            the ``chat_id`` of a previous :class:`TaskResult` to run
            this task in the same chat — the agent then sees the prior
            tasks and results of that chat as context.  A new chat is
            started when empty.
        system_prompt: Optional custom system prompt for the run.
            When non-empty it is used as the system prompt of the
            agent AND of every sub-agent it spawns (``run_parallel``),
            replacing the default system prompt shipped in
            ``src/kiss/SYSTEM.md``.  The daemon still appends its
            per-run operational instructions (work directory, process
            id, ``$KISS_HOME/AGENTS.md``) so the agent's tool contract
            keeps working.  Empty (default) runs with the default
            system prompt as usual.
        sea_path: Optional path — a string — to a Python
            file defining a Sorcar Extension Agent (SEA) that
            configures this run **on the daemon**.  When non-empty, the
            daemon loads the file's one subclass of
            :class:`kiss.agents.seas.base.base_sea.BaseSea` and applies
            its methods (:mod:`kiss.agents.sorcar.sea_commands`,
            :func:`kiss.agents.sorcar.sea_apply.apply_sea`) on top
            of the values passed to this call: a setting the SEA
            declares replaces the parameter of the same name; one it
            does not declare keeps the value passed here.

            File format — one class deriving from ``BaseSea`` that
            overrides any of its methods (every one has an identity
            default)::

                from kiss.agents.seas.base.base_sea import BaseSea

                class MySea(BaseSea):
                    def description(self) -> str: ...            # /xxx help text
                    def settings(self, settings: dict) -> dict:  # settings | {kind, run() keywords}

            A SEA extends another by deriving from its class (the
            launcher runs every class of the chain, base first; do not
            call ``super()``).  ``settings`` returns its argument with
            a ``kind`` and any of the keyword parameters of this
            function except the transport, identity and prompt ones
            (``prompt`` and ``system_prompt`` are the methods above,
            not settings) laid over it: ``work_dir``,
            ``model``, ``chat_id``, ``use_worktree``, ``auto_commit``,
            ``max_budget`` (finite), ``model_config``,
            ``use_web_tools``, ``auto_classify``, ``use_memory``,
            ``allow_fan_out``, ``tool_profile``, ``docker_image``; plus
            two dispatcher keys: ``timeout`` (seconds a ``run_agent``
            call waits for this SEA's sub-task) and ``locked`` (keys an
            explicit caller argument may not change).  ``prompt(task)``
            receives the task text
            and returns the prompt body; every ``{task_id}`` of the
            result is replaced by *parent_task_id*.  A ``None`` value,
            or ``""`` for a string key, means "no
            override".  A kind is pure defaults under the explicit
            keys: ``session`` (the default, changes nothing) or
            ``worker`` (``use_worktree``, ``auto_commit``,
            ``auto_classify``, ``allow_fan_out``, ``use_web_tools``,
            ``use_memory`` all off).  The separate flag ``channel:
            True`` marks a messaging channel: it forces ``worker``,
            defaults ``work_dir`` to ``$KISS_HOME/channel_work`` and
            locks it with the worker keys, gives the run the channel
            preamble and a workspace held for the run, makes a
            ``run_agent`` sub-task of it inherit nothing from the
            caller, and lists it as a channel.

            ``system_prompt(system_prompt)`` receives the run's
            assembled system prompt (the base prompt plus
            *add_to_system_prompt*) and returns the run's: the same
            text with additions, or a replacement.  ``tools(tools)``
            receives the built-in toolset and returns the run's: a list
            of tool callables (never a file path); with
            ``"tool_profile": "none"`` it starts empty, so what it
            returns and ``finish`` are the run's whole tool set (the
            default ``SYSTEM.md`` prompt, whose workflow rules name
            ``Read``, ``Edit``, ``Bash`` and the browser tools, should
            then usually be replaced by a ``system_prompt`` written for
            the tools the run has).  Each tool's name, docstring
            (Google-style ``Args:`` section) and annotated
            keyword-bindable parameters define the tool schema the
            agent sees, exactly like a native tool.

            The two hook methods are passed to the underlying
            :meth:`kiss.core.kiss_agent.KISSAgent.run` of every
            task-executor sub-session of the task's agent (internal
            helper sessions, e.g. the failed-session trajectory
            summarizer, are not hooked).  Per that method's contract,
            ``llm_call_hook(new_messages)`` is called before every LLM
            call and its return value replaces the new messages about
            to be sent, and ``tool_call_hook(name, args)`` is called
            before every tool call and returns a ``Verdict``: the tool
            executes on ``ALLOW``; on ``refuse(text)`` the model is
            given *text* as the tool's result instead.  The hooks apply
            to the task's own agent, not to sub-agents it spawns via
            ``run_parallel``.

            A SEA whose ``register_as_model()`` returns ``True`` is
            listed in the model picker under its command name (the
            bundled ``autorouter`` and ``bestrouter``); picking it runs
            every task of the tab through the SEA on the model its
            ``settings()["model"]`` names (else the default model),
            with the protocol its ``system_prompt`` method adds to the
            system prompt.

            Everything the script defines runs **in the daemon
            process**; nothing is serialized by the client.
            ``timeout``, *stop_on_timeout*, *endpoint_file*,
            *scope_work_dir*, *parent_task_id*, and *parent_tab_id*
            have no settings key by design: the first three are
            client-transport parameters — the script only runs on the
            daemon that *endpoint_file* selects, *timeout* bounds this
            client's local wait, and *stop_on_timeout* picks this
            client's timeout behavior — and *scope_work_dir* /
            *parent_task_id* / *parent_tab_id* are the CALLING task's
            identity, which the script must not be able to forge.  The
            *sea_path* itself is resolved against this
            process's working directory and validated eagerly.  A
            broken SEA (deleted before the daemon reads it,
            raising at import time, a non-callable getter, a raising
            ``settings()`` or getter, an unknown settings key or
            kind, or a wrong-typed value) stops the task: the daemon
            fails the run and the returned :class:`TaskResult` carries
            the diagnostic error in its ``text`` with ``success=False``.
        use_worktree: Run the task in an isolated git worktree.
            Defaults to True.
        auto_commit: Auto-commit the task's changes on success.
            Defaults to True.
        max_budget: Per-task budget override in USD; ``None`` uses the
            daemon's configured default.
        model_config: Per-task model configuration override (custom
            endpoint / headers); ``None`` uses the daemon's configured
            model endpoint.  Must be JSON-serializable.
        use_web_tools: Per-task browser-tool enablement override,
            mapped to the agent's ``web_tools`` toggle
            (:meth:`kiss.agents.sorcar.sorcar_agent.SorcarAgent.run`);
            ``None`` uses the daemon's configured default (the
            settings panel's "Use web tools" checkbox, persisted as
            ``use_web_browser``).
        auto_classify: Per-task override of pre-run task
            classification (``kiss.agents.sorcar.task_classifier``),
            which runs one lightweight model call before the task — a
            typed question to a decisions model when an OpenRouter key
            is configured and the settings panel's "Use Jev"
            checkbox (``classify_with_decisions``) is on, else a
            non-agentic call on the run's own LLM — to pick the system
            prompt (lite vs. full) and decide worktree isolation for
            the run (the verdict can only
            demote a run that asked for a worktree to direct
            execution; a *use_worktree* of ``False`` passed here is
            never overridden).  ``True`` forces
            classification on, ``False`` skips it — the run then keeps
            the *use_worktree* value passed here and the full system
            prompt — and ``None`` (the default) uses the daemon's
            configured default (the settings panel's "Classify tasks
            before running" checkbox, persisted as ``classify_tasks``).
        use_memory: Per-task persistent-memory override
            (``kiss.core.memoryfield``), mapped to the agent's
            ``use_memory`` toggle
            (:meth:`kiss.agents.sorcar.sorcar_agent.SorcarAgent.run`).
            ``True`` gives the run (and its ``run_parallel``
            sub-agents) the ``memory_*`` tools plus the
            ``MEMORY_PROTOCOL`` prompt block, ``False`` withholds
            them, and ``None`` (the default) uses the daemon's
            configured default (the settings panel's "Use persistent
            memory" checkbox, persisted as ``use_memory``, or the
            daemon process's ``KISS_USE_MEMORY`` environment
            variable).  A boolean override never bypasses the memory
            safety gates: a run without the basic toolset (the
            ``none`` tool profile), a Docker run, a
            run-to-completion CLI model (``cc/*``, ``codex/*``), or a
            caller-supplied ``model_config["system_instruction"]``
            stays memory-free even with ``True``.
        allow_fan_out: Whether the agent may spawn parallel sub-agents
            (the ``run_parallel`` tool).  Defaults to True.
        add_to_system_prompt: Extra text appended to the run's
            system prompt when the agent is executed — after the
            default ``SYSTEM.md`` prompt (or the *system_prompt*
            replacement) and before the daemon's per-run operational
            instructions.  ``run_parallel`` sub-agents inherit the
            suffix on their own system prompts, like a *system_prompt*
            replacement, so the extra instructions constrain the whole
            task tree.  Empty (default) appends nothing.
        add_to_prompt: Extra text appended to the executed task
            prompt.  A multi-``<task>`` *prompt* runs the agent once
            per subtask, and the text is appended to EACH subtask's
            prompt.  The appended text is part of the prompt the agent
            actually runs with, so it is also what the chat history
            records and what follow-up tasks of the same chat see as
            context.  Empty (default) appends nothing.
        tool_profile: Name of the tool profile the task's built-in
            toolset is cut down to — a key of
            :data:`kiss.agents.sorcar.sorcar_agent.TOOL_PROFILES`
            (the composites ``"full"``, ``"review"``, ``"assistant"``,
            ``"bash"`` or the groups ``"shell"``, ``"edit"``,
            ``"browser"``, ``"memory"``, ``"agents"``, ``"mcp"``,
            ``"skills"``, ``"user"``, ``"decide"``, ``"control"``), or
            several keys joined with ``+`` for the union of their
            tools (``"shell+edit+memory"``); ``bash`` is the
            single-command runner of the bundled ``/sh`` agent:
            ``Bash`` and ``finish`` only; ``none`` keeps no built-in
            tool at all (``finish`` plus what the SEA's ``tools()``
            returns, the bundled ``/ask`` agent).  Empty
            (the default) keeps the daemon's usual choice (the full
            toolset).
            An unknown name stops the task with a diagnostic error.
        docker_image: Run the task's file and shell tools (``Bash``,
            ``run_commands_parallel``, ``Read``, ``Edit``, ``Write``)
            inside a Docker container instead of on the daemon's host.
            An image name (``"python:3.12"``) starts a fresh container
            that is removed when the task ends; ``container:<name-or-id>``
            attaches to a container the caller already runs and leaves
            it running.  ``run_parallel`` sub-agents share the task's
            container.  ``bash_job`` and persistent memory are
            unavailable in a Docker run.  Empty (default) runs the
            tools on the host.
        inherit_tools: Whether the task also gets the extra tools of
            the task *parent_task_id* names — the tool callables that
            parent's SEA added through ``tools()`` (and those the
            parent inherited itself), resolved on the daemon from the
            running parent (a callable cannot travel the wire).  They
            are added to the task's built-in toolset before the task's
            own SEA's ``tools()`` sees it, skipping names the task
            already has; a SEA on the ``none`` tool profile keeps
            exactly its own set.
            ``run_agent`` sets this for the
            sub-tasks it dispatches in path mode, so a sub-task that
            inherits the caller's system prompt also has the tools
            that prompt refers to.  ``False`` (default) adds nothing;
            ignored without *parent_task_id*.
        workspace: Workspace/account identifier for multi-account
            channels.  A channel SEA's run (``channel: True``) holds
            it (``KISS_CHANNEL_WORKSPACE``) for its whole lifetime, so
            its channel tools load that account's credentials; empty
            means ``"default"``.  Ignored by every other run.
        provenance: Where the command's values come from, ``{setting
            key: "explicit" | "inherited"}`` (see
            :mod:`kiss.agents.sorcar.run_config`): a field the caller
            was given explicitly, or one it filled from the agent
            calling it.  Recorded in the task's ``task_settings`` event
            (``inherited``), so the result's ``ran:`` line and the
            persisted history show which values the sub-task took over.
            ``None`` (default): every value is a persisted setting or
            the daemon's default.
        timeout: Maximum seconds to wait for the task to finish;
            ``None`` waits indefinitely.  With *stop_on_timeout* it is
            also sent to the daemon (wire field ``timeout``), which
            records it in the task's ``task_settings`` event.
        stop_on_timeout: Whether a *timeout* expiry also STOPS the
            task.  ``False`` (the default) keeps the documented
            timeout contract — the caller stops waiting, the task
            keeps running.  With ``True`` the client sends the daemon
            a ``stop`` for the task and keeps reading until the task's
            terminal status confirms it is dead (waiting up to
            :data:`_STOP_CONFIRM_GRACE_SECONDS`; on a wedged daemon
            :class:`StopUnconfirmedTimeoutError` is raised instead,
            the stop then staying best-effort) before raising the
            ``TimeoutError``.
            ``True`` is for callers that must not let the task outlive
            the wait (the ``/ask`` side channel, ``commands.py``).  The
            ``run_agent`` dispatch does not use it: its ``timeout``
            bounds the call only, and its sub-task is stopped through
            *cancel* (an ``agent_job`` kill, or the calling run's end).
            When the task finished ON ITS OWN — a SUCCESSFUL terminal
            ``result`` AND the terminal status raced the stop onto the
            wire — the completed :class:`TaskResult` is returned
            instead of a ``TimeoutError`` that would discard the
            finished work (only natural completions carry ``success:
            true``; every daemon stop/cancel/failure path broadcasts
            ``success: false``).  A successful result WITHOUT the
            terminal status never settles the wait: the daemon's
            persistence / auto-commit / worktree cleanup still run
            after the result is emitted, so only the terminal status
            proves the task is dead, and the grace expiring with just
            the result in hand raises
            :class:`StopUnconfirmedTimeoutError` all the same.
        record_timeout: A bound to send as the wire field ``timeout``
            (recorded in the task's ``task_settings`` and checked
            against a SEA's locked ``timeout``) when this wait itself
            has none: ``run_agent`` waits here without a deadline on a
            job thread and bounds the call by joining that thread, so
            it passes the call's bound through this.  ``None`` sends
            *timeout* when *stop_on_timeout*, else nothing.
        endpoint_file: Daemon endpoint file override (defaults to
            ``$KISS_SORCAR_LOCAL`` or ``$KISS_HOME/sorcar-local.json``).
        cancel: An event the caller may set from another thread to
            stop the task (``agent_job(..., "kill")``): the daemon is
            sent a ``stop`` and the wait continues until the task's
            terminal status confirms it is dead (or the confirmation
            grace expires), then :class:`CancelledError` is raised with
            ``confirmed`` set accordingly.  ``None`` (the default)
            waits for the task or the timeout.
        running: An event set when the task's initial ``status
            running=true`` arrives — the moment its tab exists on every
            client.  Not set by a wait that ends without one: the
            ``run_agent`` job thread sets it after recording the
            dispatch's outcome, so a ``wait="false"`` call woken by it
            either has a tab to report or the finished result.

    Returns:
        A :class:`TaskResult` with the result text, success flag, cost
        (USD), total tokens, step count, chat id, and task id of the
        task.  ``chat_id`` is the daemon chat session id and
        ``task_id`` the persisted ``task_history`` row id — both
        usable later to look up or resume the run in the daemon's
        history.

    Raises:
        ValueError: When *prompt* is empty or blank, or when
            *sea_path* is neither empty nor the path string
            of an existing Python (``.py``) file (see
            :func:`resolve_sea_path`).
        ConnectionError: When no daemon is reachable at the endpoint,
            the daemon drops the connection before the task finishes,
            or a *stop_on_timeout* stop cannot be sent on the broken
            connection (a plain ``TimeoutError`` would falsely imply
            the task was stopped).
        TimeoutError: When the task does not finish within *timeout*
            seconds (never raised when *timeout* is ``None``).  The
            client then sends the daemon an explicit
            ``closeTab`` for the task's tab and disconnects; the task
            keeps running and its state is disposed when it ends —
            unless *stop_on_timeout* is true, in which case the task
            is first stopped and its terminal status awaited (see the
            parameter's documentation).
        StopUnconfirmedTimeoutError: When *stop_on_timeout* is true
            and the stop was sent but the daemon never confirmed the
            task's death within :data:`_STOP_CONFIRM_GRACE_SECONDS` —
            the task may still be running.  A subclass of
            ``TimeoutError``, so a plain ``except TimeoutError`` still
            catches it.
        StoppedOnTimeoutError: When *stop_on_timeout* is true and the
            daemon confirmed the stop; its ``result`` carries the
            stopped task's spend.  A subclass of ``TimeoutError``.

    Every other abort of the wait — most importantly the
    ``KeyboardInterrupt`` injected when the CALLING task is stopped
    while blocked in a ``run_agent`` dispatch — additionally sends the
    daemon a ``stop`` for the dispatched task's tab before
    disconnecting.  Without the cascade, the orphaned sub-task kept
    running invisibly and, when it was a non-worktree task, kept its
    repository flagged busy: a manual Git Commit pressed after the
    parent showed "Task stopped by user" was refused with "A task is
    still running in this folder" with no visible task running.  A
    timeout intentionally does NOT stop the task (see above) unless
    *stop_on_timeout* is true: by default the caller chose to stop
    waiting, not to cancel the work.  Such an abort's exception gets a
    ``task_result`` attribute: a :class:`TaskResult` with the spend the
    dispatched task had reported so far, so the caller can still
    charge it.
