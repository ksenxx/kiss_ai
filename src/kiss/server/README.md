# Writing Sorcar Extension Agents (SEAs) for KISS Sorcar

## What is a SEA?

A **Sorcar Extension Agent (SEA)** is a small Python file that describes
a specialised version of the Sorcar assistant.  Think of Sorcar as a
capable general employee, and a SEA as a job description plus a rulebook
you hand that employee before a particular kind of job.  The file can say:

- **What the job is.**  The base class says what the run is: `BaseSea`
  is an ordinary session, `WorkerSea` a lightweight worker with no git
  worktree, browser or memory, `ChannelSea` a worker that serves an
  external service.  `settings()` sets the run parameters the SEA
  cares about: the model, the tool profile, the working directory, how
  long a caller waits for it.  A caller may still ask for a different
  value unless the SEA marks the key `locked`; whatever the SEA does
  not set keeps what the caller asked for.
- **How to phrase the task.**  `prompt(task)` rewrites the text the user
  typed into the prompt the agent actually receives.
- **What the agent knows and may do.**  `system_prompt()` adjusts the
  standing instructions; `tools()` adds, removes or replaces the tools
  the agent can call, so a SEA can bring its own tools (a weather
  lookup, a task database) or lock the agent down to a bare shell.
- **What to watch.**  `tool_call_hook` and `llm_call_hook` run before
  each tool and model call the agent makes, so a SEA can guard, log or
  veto actions.
- **What it is for.**  `description()` is the one-sentence help text
  shown for the SEA's chat command.

A SEA only writes down what it changes; everything else is inherited
from a base that already does the right thing, and one SEA can build on
another the way one job description can extend another.  Users reach a
SEA by typing `/<name>` in the chat, by picking it on a tab, by calling
`sorcar.run()` with its path, or when an agent delegates to it with
`run_agent`.  The file runs inside the Sorcar daemon and is re-read from
source on every run, so editing it takes effect immediately.  The rest
of this document is the precise contract behind that picture.

## The contract

A **Sorcar Extension Agent (SEA)** is a Python file that defines one
class deriving from `kiss.agents.seas.base.base_sea.BaseSea` —
directly for an ordinary session, through `WorkerSea` for a focused
tool-bound run on the caller's tree, through `ChannelSea` for an agent
that serves an external service; you pass the file's path as
`sea_path` to `kiss.server.sorcar.run()`.
The daemon executes the file, instantiates the class and threads the
run's configuration through its methods: `settings(settings)` returns
the `run()` parameters the SEA pins (the daemon writes them over the
run's parameters; the rest keep what the caller passed), `prompt(task)`
turns the task text
into the prompt,
`system_prompt(system_prompt)` and `tools(tools)` receive the run's
assembled system prompt and toolset and return the ones to use, and
`tool_call_hook(name, args)` / `llm_call_hook(new_messages)` are
called around every tool and LLM call.  Every method has an identity
default on `BaseSea`, so a SEA defines only what it changes.  A SEA
builds on another by Python inheritance.  `BaseSea` is also the root
layer of every run made from the chat: a plain prompt runs the bare
`BaseSea`, a `/xxx` command or a picker tab runs its SEA on top of it,
and `run_agent` / `run_parallel` children go through it too — so
editing `src/kiss/agents/seas/base/base_sea.py` (and restarting the
daemon, which imports it once) customizes every such run at once (see
[Customizing every run](#customizing-every-run)).  Everything the file defines
executes **in the daemon process** and is re-executed from source on
every run (no `__pycache__` is written) by the one loader
`kiss.agents.sorcar.sea_settings.execute_python_file`.

Each SEA lives in its own folder named after it, `<name>/<name>_sea.py`,
together with the helper modules and data files it needs (the bundled
`src/kiss/agents/seas/sh/sh_sea.py` and
`src/kiss/agents/third_party_agents/slack/slack_sea.py` are laid out this
way).  A SEA exposed as a command must define `description()`,
returning one sentence that says what the SEA does and how to use it.
It is what the chat command `/<name> help` prints (see the
slash-command bullet under [Tips](#tips)).

This tutorial covers every `settings()` key and base class, the other
methods, how `run_agent` and `/xxx` commands run a SEA, error
handling, and ends with a complete working example.

### Prerequisites

- A running `kiss-web` daemon (start one with `kiss-web`).
- At least one model available to the daemon: an LLM provider API key
  (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter, etc.) or an installed Claude
  Code / Codex CLI executable (`cc/*`, `codex/*` models).
- Any Python packages your SEA imports must be available
  in the daemon's Python environment.


## Quick start

```python
# weather/weather_sea.py — a minimal SEA

from typing import Any

import requests

from kiss.agents.seas.base.base_sea import WorkerSea


def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Return current weather for a city from wttr.in.

    Args:
        city: City name to look up.
    """
    resp = requests.get(f"https://wttr.in/{city}?format=3", timeout=10)
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return resp.text.strip()


class WeatherSea(WorkerSea):  # a worker: no worktree, auto-commit, classifier, browser, memory
    def description(self) -> str:
        return (
            "Reports the current weather in San Francisco from wttr.in; "
            "pass its path as sea_path or send `/weather now` "
            "(any text after the command) once its parent folder is listed "
            "in $KISS_HOME/SEAS.md."
        )

    def settings(self, settings: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return settings | {
            "tool_profile": "none",  # no built-in tool: get_weather + finish only
            "max_budget": 0.50,
        }

    def prompt(self, task: str) -> str:
        # The task is what the caller typed after ``/weather`` or passed
        # to ``run_agent``; the SEA turns it into the prompt body.
        return f"Look up the current weather in {task or 'San Francisco'} and report it."

    def system_prompt(self, system_prompt: str) -> str:
        # Replaces the assembled system prompt.
        return (
            "You are a weather assistant. Use the get_weather tool "
            "to look up weather, then call finish with the result."
        )

    def tools(self, tools: list[Any]) -> list[Any]:
        # ``tools`` is the run's toolset so far (empty under ``tool_profile: "none"``).
        return tools + [get_weather]
```

Launch it:

```python
from kiss.server import sorcar

result = sorcar.run(
    "Paris",  # the task; the SEA's prompt(task) turns it into the prompt
    sea_path="weather/weather_sea.py",
)
print(result.text, result.success, result.cost)
```

The client-side `prompt` argument must be non-empty (the client
validates this before connecting to the daemon); it is the task the
SEA's `prompt(task)` receives on the daemon.  A SEA without `prompt()`
runs the task text as its prompt.


## How it works

                                             ▼
                                         agent.run(system_prompt_hook=…, tools_hook=…, …)

```

1. **Client side** — `sorcar.run()` validates that `sea_path`
   points to an existing `.py` file, resolves it to an absolute path,
   and sends it as `"seaPath"` on the wire.  `None` or `""` means
   no SEA; any other non-string value (including a
   `pathlib.Path`), a non-`.py` path, or a nonexistent file raises
   `ValueError` immediately (before any daemon connection).

2. **Daemon side** — the task runner executes the file once and
   instantiates the one `BaseSea` subclass it defines
   (`kiss.agents.sorcar.sea_commands.load_sea`; a model-picker SEA
   chosen on the tab is loaded too and applied first,
   `sea_commands.sea_layers`).  The settings are folded over the
   class's inheritance chain, base first (`sea_commands.base_settings`:
   each class's own `settings(settings)` receives the dict so far and
   returns the next one — `WorkerSea` and `ChannelSea` lay their
   defaults there, under the subclass's keys), then resolved
   (`kiss.agents.sorcar.sea_settings.resolve_settings`: every value
   type-checked, a channel's locked keys enforced).
   `apply_sea()` (in `kiss.agents.sorcar.sea_apply`)
   then evaluates the SEA on the task (`evaluate_sea`), writes each
   setting into the command dict's wire field and the result of the
   `prompt(task)` chain into `prompt`, and stages the four daemon-side
   hooks (`DAEMON_SIDE_FIELDS`: `systemPromptHook`, `toolsHook`,
   `llmCallHook`, `toolCallHook`), each a fold of that method over
   the chain, base first.  Overrides are staged: they apply atomically
   only after everything succeeds.  A broken script raises
   `SeaError` and the task fails with a diagnostic message in
   `TaskResult.text`.

3. **Run-time hooks** — the hooks never travel the wire (a callable
   cannot).  When the agent starts, `systemPromptHook` is called once
   with the assembled system prompt (the daemon's base prompt or the
   caller's `system_prompt`, plus the caller's `add_to_system_prompt`
   and the channel preamble) and its return value is the run's system
   prompt; `toolsHook` is called once with the built-in toolset (of
   the run's tool profile; empty under `"none"`) plus the tools
   inherited from the calling task, and its return value is the run's
   toolset (`finish` is always added).  `llmCallHook` and
   `toolCallHook` run around every LLM and tool call.  Nothing is
   re-imported.


## `settings()`: the run parameters

A SEA pins the parameters of its run with ONE optional method,
`settings(self, settings)`, which receives the dict its base classes
built (`{}` for a direct `BaseSea` subclass, the worker defaults for
a `WorkerSea`) and returns the dict to use: any of the keys below
(`sea_settings.SETTING_TYPES`).  What the run *is* — a session, a
worker, a channel — is the base class, not a key.  Return `settings |
{...}` to add or override keys and keep the base's; return a dict
without a key to drop it.  Every key but `timeout`, `locked` and
`hidden` (`sea_settings.DISPATCHER_SETTINGS`) is a parameter of
`sorcar.run()` and lands on that parameter's wire field
(`sea_apply.SETTING_FIELDS`); the wire name is the keyword in camelCase
(`sea_settings.wire_field`: `use_web_tools` → `useWebTools`), with
three aliases kept from the wire protocol's earlier vocabulary
(`auto_classify` → `classifyTasks`, `add_to_prompt` → `appendToPrompt`,
`add_to_system_prompt` → `appendToSystemPrompt`), so no hand-kept
table is needed.
Extra tools have no `run()` parameter at all (a callable cannot travel
the wire): they come from the `tools(tools)` method (see below).  The
bundled `/sh` agent is the whole pattern:

```python
class ShSea(WorkerSea):
    def settings(self, settings: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """A worker with Bash only, on the real checkout, running SYSTEM_PROMPT."""
        return settings | {
            "tool_profile": "bash",
            "locked": ["tool_profile"],
        }
```

Generated by `uv run sea docs` from `sea_settings.SETTING_TYPES`; the
`run()` default of a key the script leaves out is the daemon's.

<!-- sea-docs: settings -->
| Key | Type | `run` wire field | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `work_dir` | `str` | `workDir` | The directory the run works in; default: the calling task's or the tab's. A relative path is a path under the calling task's directory (the tab's for `/<name>`), in a SEA's settings and in a call's `work_dir` option alike. |
| `model` | `str` | `model` | The LLM model, a catalogue name or a model-picker SEA; default: the caller's (`""`, like `None`, is no override — true of every string key). |
| `chat_id` | `str` | `chatId` | The chat the run's events go to; default under `run_agent`: the calling task's chat, or a new chat when nothing is inherited (a channel, an `inherit: false` call); a `/<name>` run keeps the tab's chat. |
| `use_worktree` | `bool` | `useWorktree` | Run in a git worktree of the project; default: the calling task's effective choice, else the persisted setting (an inherited or default `True` is demoted by the classifier for non-implementation tasks, an explicit `True` is kept). |
| `auto_commit` | `bool` | `autoCommit` | Commit the run's changes when it ends; default: the calling task's effective choice, else the persisted setting. |
| `max_budget` | `int \| float` | `maxBudget` | USD budget of the run, a finite number; default: the caller's share or the daemon's default. |
| `model_config` | `dict` | `modelConfig` | Model configuration dict passed to the LLM (temperature, base URL, ...). |
| `use_web_tools` | `bool` | `useWebTools` | Give the run the browser tools (daemon default: on). |
| `auto_classify` | `bool` | `classifyTasks` | Let the pre-run classifier decide the worktree mode and lite prompt (daemon default: the persisted setting). |
| `use_memory` | `bool` | `useMemory` | Give the run the `memory_*` tools (daemon default: the persisted setting). |
| `tool_profile` | `str` | `toolProfile` | The run's toolset: `review`, `bash`, `shell+edit`, ... (default: the full toolset). |
| `docker_image` | `str` | `dockerImage` | Run inside this Docker image (default: the host). |
| `timeout` | `int \| float` | — | Seconds a `run_agent` / `run_parallel` call blocks for the run: the call's `timeout` argument wins, then this setting, then 3600. When it expires the run is not stopped: it keeps going as an `agent_job` and the call returns its job id (a job still running when the calling task ends is killed). Ignored by `/<name>`. |
| `locked` | `list` | — | Keys an explicit `run_agent` / `run_parallel` argument or option may not change: a differing value is an error. |
| `hidden` | `bool` | — | `True`: the script is no `/command` and no `run_agent` agent name (loadable by path and as a base class only). It must be the literal `True` in the class's `settings()` because the command registry reads it from the source without running the script (a computed value is ignored). |
<!-- /sea-docs -->

A key whose value is `None` is dropped and behaves like an absent
key — as is a `model` of `""` — so the caller's or the persisted
value stands (a `WorkerSea` subclass returning `settings |
{"use_memory": None}` writes "no override" over the worker default;
leave the key out to keep the default).  A `bool` key given a
non-`bool`, an `int`/`float` key given a `bool`, an unknown, renamed or
removed key (`kind`, `channel` and `allow_fan_out` among the removed
ones), or a non-finite `max_budget` / `timeout` stops the task with a
diagnostic (see [Error handling](#error-handling)).

The prompt itself is not a setting: `settings()` is data, text and
code come from the other methods.  Two optional methods are the only
prompt surfaces:

| Method                           | Returns | Effect                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `prompt(self, task)`             | `str` (non-empty) | the prompt body for the task text the run was submitted with (the text after `/xxx`, the `run_agent` task, the `sorcar.run()` prompt); every `{task_id}` of the final text is replaced by the calling task's id (the command's `parentTaskId`, `""` without one); without it the task text is the prompt |
| `system_prompt(self, system_prompt)` | `str` | receives the run's assembled system prompt (the base prompt plus the caller's suffix and the channel preamble) and returns the one to use: `return SYSTEM_PROMPT` replaces it, `return system_prompt + "\n\n" + PROTOCOL` appends to it |

### Base classes

The base class says what the run is.  `BaseSea` lays nothing;
`WorkerSea(BaseSea)` lays `WORKER_DEFAULTS` under its subclass's keys;
`ChannelSea(WorkerSea)` adds the scratch `work_dir` and the behaviours
of the next section (`sea_settings.base_class_defaults()` is the
table).  A subclass that writes one of those keys overrides the
default, as with any base.

<!-- sea-docs: bases -->
| Base class | Lays | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `BaseSea` | nothing | The default: an ordinary Sorcar session with the caller's or the user's settings (`/write`, `/write_paper`, `bestrouter`). |
| `WorkerSea` | `use_worktree=False`, `auto_commit=False`, `auto_classify=False`, `use_web_tools=False`, `use_memory=False` | A focused tool-bound run on the caller's tree: lays the worker defaults (no worktree, no auto-commit, no classifier, no browser, no memory) under the SEA's own keys (`/sh`, `/ask`, `/merge`, `/remember`, `/forget`, `/task_update`). |
| `ChannelSea` | `use_worktree=False`, `auto_commit=False`, `auto_classify=False`, `use_web_tools=False`, `use_memory=False`, `work_dir='<home>/channel_work'` | A worker that serves an external service (Slack, email, cron), not the caller's project; every behaviour this adds is listed in the channel table. The command registry reads the base name from the source, so a channel derives from `ChannelSea` by that name. |
<!-- /sea-docs -->

### Channels: `class XSea(ChannelSea)`

A SEA that serves an external service (Slack, email, cron) derives
from `ChannelSea`, by that name (the command registry reads the base
name from the source).  Every bundled channel is `class
XSea(ChannelSea)` with no `settings()` method at all; cron is
`CronAgentSea(ChannelSea)` with `work_dir: cron_work_dir()`.  The base
class is the one thing with behaviour beyond a value passed through;
every behaviour is listed in `sea_settings.CHANNEL_BEHAVIOURS`,
rendered here, and the module named in each row is where it is
enforced.

<!-- sea-docs: channel -->
| Behaviour | What deriving from `ChannelSea` does |
|---|---|
| worker | It is a `WorkerSea`, and the worker keys are locked, so no call may give it a worktree, auto-commit, the classifier, the browser or memory (`resolve_settings`). |
| scratch directory | It runs in the shared `<home>/channel_work` scratch directory unless its own `work_dir` says otherwise (`/cron` runs in `<home>/cron_work`); `work_dir` is locked, so it never works in the caller's project (`resolve_settings`). |
| no inheritance | Its `run_agent` dispatch takes nothing from the calling task: not the chat, model, budget share, container or prompt suffixes; the `inherit: true` option is refused (`agent_dispatch`). |
| workspace | It holds its channel workspace — the `run_agent` option `workspace`, default `default`, the account its tools load credentials for — from before its `tools()` run until the run ends; `workspace` is refused for any other SEA (`sea_apply.channel_workspace`, `agent_dispatch`). |
| preamble | The channel preamble is appended to its system prompt before its own `system_prompt()` runs (`sea_apply.CHANNEL_PREAMBLE`). |
| listed as a channel | A third-party SEA folder whose class derives from `ChannelSea` by that name is a channel agent: `run_agent(agent="<folder>")` finds it by name and the `channel` tool lists it (`agent_dispatch.available_channels`, `declares_channel`). |
<!-- /sea-docs -->

The channel preamble (`sea_apply.CHANNEL_PREAMBLE`, "You are the
{name} agent: this session already has the {name} tools ... Never call
run_agent here ...", `{name}` being the script's file stem without
`_sea`) is appended to the system prompt suffix the SEA's
`system_prompt()` receives.  The workspace (the account the channel
tools load credentials for, exported as `KISS_CHANNEL_WORKSPACE`) is
held from before `tools()` runs — the tools bind the credentials of
the workspace active at that moment — until the run ends, whether the
run came from `/slack ...`, `run_agent("slack")` or
`run_agent(".../slack_sea.py")`; a run whose workspace differs from a
running channel task's waits (bounded by
`channel_workspace.WORKSPACE_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) instead of handing
that task the wrong credentials.  A channel is not meant as a base
class (see [Extending a SEA](#extending-a-sea-python-inheritance)).  A
channel SEA is three methods and its base class:

```python
class SlackSea(ChannelSea):
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "Messages, channels, users, reactions and search in a Slack workspace ..."

    def system_prompt(self, system_prompt: str) -> str:
        return system_prompt + "\n\n" + SlackAgent.channel_system_prompt

    def tools(self, tools: list[Any]) -> list[Any]:
        workspace = os.environ.get("KISS_CHANNEL_WORKSPACE", "default") or "default"
        return tools + SlackAgent(workspace=workspace)._get_tools()  # the authenticated API tools
```

### Extending a SEA: Python inheritance

A SEA refines another by deriving from its class.  Import the bundled
class, or ask the registry for it by command name or path with
`kiss.agents.sorcar.sea_commands.sea_class(spec, relative_to="")`
(a registered name such as `"bestrouter"` or `"sh"`, or a path with
a `.py` suffix or a separator, resolved against the directory
`relative_to`, normally `Path(__file__).parent`, else the current
directory):

```python
# strict_sh/strict_sh_sea.py
from typing import Any

from kiss.agents.seas.base.base_sea import ALLOW, Verdict, refuse
from kiss.agents.seas.sh.sh_sea import ShSea          # or: sea_class("sh")


class StrictShSea(ShSea):
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "Runs a shell command like /sh, read-only, on a small budget."

    def settings(self, settings: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return settings | {"max_budget": 0.25}          # ShSea's keys stay

    def tool_call_hook(self, name: str, args: dict[str, Any]) -> Verdict:
        if name == "Bash" and "rm " in str(args.get("command", "")):
            return refuse("Blocked: read-only run")
        return ALLOW
```

The launcher applies every class of the inheritance chain that defines
a method, base class first (`sea_commands._chain` walks the MRO), so a
method must **not** call `super()`: the base's `settings()` has already
run when the subclass's receives the dict.  Per method:

- `settings(settings)`: each class receives the dict so far and returns
  the next; a later class's key wins and a key it leaves out of its
  return is dropped.  Return `settings | {...}` to keep the base's keys.
- `prompt(task)`: chained; the subclass's receives what the base's returned.
- `system_prompt(system_prompt)`, `tools(tools)`, `llm_call_hook(new_messages)`:
  folded the same way, base first; each class receives the previous
  result and returns the next.
- `tool_call_hook(name, args)`: the classes are asked in order and the
  first refusal (`refuse(text)`) wins; `ALLOW` allows.
- `description()`, `register_as_model()`, `on_picked_as_model(work_dir)`:
  ordinary Python inheritance; the most derived definition is the one
  called.

`BaseSea` heads every chain, so its methods run first on every run
(identities until you edit them).  `system_prompt` is folded exactly
like `prompt`: each class receives the text so far and what it returns
is the text, whether it appended to it or replaced it; the run uses
the last return verbatim.  Neither method's return reaches a
sub-agent: a `run_agent` / `run_parallel` child inherits only the
caller-supplied `system_prompt` and `add_to_system_prompt` options and
its own layers build its prompt, so a rule a layer appends is stated
once per run without any deduplication.

### Customizing every run

Every run made from the chat — a plain prompt, a `/xxx` command, a run
on a model-picker tab, a `run_agent` or `run_parallel` child — goes
through `src/kiss/agents/seas/base/base_sea.py` as its first layer.  To
change what all of them do, edit that file's methods and restart the
daemon (the file is imported once, unlike SEA files, which are
re-executed on every run):

```python
class BaseSea:
    def settings(self, settings):
        return settings | {"use_memory": True}   # subject to sea_settings.PRECEDENCE_RULE

    def system_prompt(self, system_prompt):
        return system_prompt + "\n\nAnswer in British English."

    def tools(self, tools):
        return tools + [my_house_tool]

    def tool_call_hook(self, name, args):
        if name == "Bash" and "rm -rf" in str(args.get("command", "")):
            return refuse("Blocked: destructive command")
        return ALLOW
```

A plain chat prompt still names no SEA and runs the bare `BaseSea`; a
`run_agent` or `run_parallel` call with an empty `agent` runs the
hidden `seas/sorcar/sorcar_sea.py` and is reported as `sorcar`.
`/xxx check` lists the methods a SEA adds on top of `BaseSea`, not the
base's own.

A model-picker SEA chosen on the tab (`bestrouter`, `autorouter`) is
applied before the SEA of every daemon-run task whose model names the
picker (`sea_commands.sea_layers`, `task_runner._picker_sea`): a
`/xxx` command typed into that tab, or a `run_agent` call that passes
the picker's name as `model`, runs its own SEA on top of the picker's
model, and the picker's methods are folded first, so a
SEA whose `system_prompt()` appends keeps the picker's routing
protocol while one that replaces the prompt (`/sh`) drops it.  A
`run_agent` or `run_parallel` child that inherits the tab's model
inherits the real model the picker resolved to, not the picker layer.
A class both share (a SEA that derives from the
tab's picker class, or a common ancestor) contributes once, in the
picker's place.  A `model` setting that names a picker entry is
resolved the same way: the run gets the picker's model (the default
model when it names none), never the picker's name.  A file must
define exactly one subclass of `BaseSea` of its own (an imported base
class does not count); none or several is an error (`load_sea`).  Do
not derive from a bundled channel SEA: the subclass would inherit the
channel's base class, workspace handling and credential-bound tools.

### Precedence

One rule decides every setting of a dispatched run
(`sea_settings.PRECEDENCE_RULE`, enforced by `locked_conflicts`; this
block is generated from the constant):

<!-- sea-docs: precedence -->
> For every setting of a sub-task: what the call passes explicitly (a `run_agent` / `run_parallel` argument or `options` key) wins, then the SEA's `settings()`, then what the calling task passes on (and, for `/<name>`, the chat panel's persisted settings), then the user's defaults. A SEA may list keys in `locked`: a call that passes a different value for a locked key is refused with an error, never silently overruled.
>
> For example, `/sh` declares `{"tool_profile": "bash", "locked": ["tool_profile"]}`, so `run_agent(agent="sh", task=..., tool_profile="review")` is refused with `Error: sh: the script locks tool_profile='bash' (asked for 'review')`, while `run_agent(agent="sh", task=..., model="gpt-5")` runs it with that model: `model` is not locked, so the explicit argument wins.
<!-- /sea-docs -->

Example of a refused call: `Error: sh: the script locks
tool_profile='bash' (asked for 'review')`.  A `/<name>` run in a tab
and a `run()` call with an `sea_path` pass nothing
explicitly (unless the `run()` call marks values `"explicit"` in its
`provenance` argument, as the dispatcher does), so there the SEA's
settings apply over the tab's or the client's values.  The `ran:` line of every sub-task result reports the
outcome: `inherited=` names the keys taken from the calling task,
`pinned=` the inherited or default values the SEA's `settings()`
replaced (`pinned=use_worktree(True->False)` for `/sh` run from a
worktree task); an explicit argument never appears there, because it
either won or was refused.  A plain sub-agent whose worktree default
the pre-run classifier dropped (a non-development task) ends with
`classified=use_worktree(True->False)`; a `tools=review(inferred)`
says nobody named the profile and the sub-agent got `review` because
it is a reviewer (see `run_parallel`'s `tool_profile`).

Inheritance (`agent_dispatch.inherit_from_parent`) applies to every
dispatched script that is not a channel, unless the call's `inherit`
option is `false`: the `run_agent` or `run_parallel`
arguments the caller leaves empty are first filled from the calling
agent: its model (and its
`model_config`, but only when the sub-task runs the model the caller
was launched with and the script's `model` setting does not pick the
model, because the script names none or the call passes `model`
itself: a script-chosen model runs with default provider routing),
its remaining budget divided by N+1 for N sub-tasks (half for one
`run_agent` call; the last share stays reserved for the caller), its
chat id (so the sub-task sees the conversation's earlier
tasks and results), its own replacement system prompt and appended
system-prompt text (the `system_prompt` / `add_to_system_prompt`
its run was given, so a run's extra system instructions constrain its
whole task tree; the classifier's
lite-vs-full choice is not among them, the sub-task is classified on
its own), the text appended to its own prompt, the extra tools its
own SEA added (so the tools the inherited system prompt
refers to exist; not into a run on the `none` profile), its web-tools
and memory settings,
its live Docker container (`container:<id>`), and
its effective worktree and auto-commit choices after the classifier's
demotion (both `False` when the container is inherited: the sub-task
then works in the caller's tree).  `run_parallel` children are
`run_agent` sub-tasks started by the same code
(`agent_dispatch.start_run_agent`), so this is their table too (the
precedence rule above decides between the
inherited values and the SEA's).  A channel SEA (`agent="slack"`,
`agent="cron"`, ...) inherits none of these: it runs on the daemon's
default model and budget unless the call passes its own, and
`ChannelSea` locks its `work_dir` and the worker keys (`use_worktree`,
`auto_commit`, `auto_classify`, `use_web_tools`,
`use_memory`), so a call whose `options` contradict one is refused.  A
`use_worktree` any SEA pins, or a `run_agent` call passes explicitly,
is a decision the task classifier never demotes (it still demotes a
client's or persisted default, and says so with `classified=`).

### `description()` — mandatory, not a run parameter

| Method              | Return type         | Used by                                   |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `description(self)` | `str` (one sentence, non-empty) | `/<name> help` in the chat (`kiss.agents.sorcar.sea_commands`) |

Every SEA exposed as a command must define `description()`, returning
one sentence saying what the SEA does and how to use it (the `BaseSea`
default returns `""`, which is fine for a hidden base class).  It
is not a run parameter: `apply_sea()` ignores it and it
never reaches the command dict.  The slash-command registry calls it
when the prompt is `/<name> help` (the bare word `help`, any letter
case, nothing after it; `sea_commands.help_text_if_command`): the
daemon does not run the SEA and calls no model, it loads the class,
calls `description()` and posts the returned sentence as the task
result.  A `description()` that raises or returns something other than
a non-empty string yields a diagnostic instead
(`sea_commands.sea_description`).

### `timeout` — optional, for SEAs that run longer than an hour

A `run_agent` or `run_parallel` call waits for its sub-task(s) for a
bounded time (`agent_dispatch.resolve_timeout`): an explicit `timeout`
argument wins; an empty one takes the SEA's `settings()["timeout"]`
when that is positive; with neither,
`DEFAULT_DISPATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, 3600 s.  When the bound expires
the sub-task is NOT stopped: it keeps running as an `agent_job` and
the call returns the job's id (`agent_job(id, "wait")` collects the
result, `"kill"` stops it; a job still running when the calling task
ends is killed).  A SEA whose runs may take longer than an hour
declares it so a caller is not handed a job id too early (`/write_paper` 6 h, `/review_paper`
2 h, `/revise_and_review_paper` 24 h); `/write` pins the default
explicitly:

```python
DISPATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 3600.0


class WriteSea(BaseSea):
    def settings(self, settings: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return settings | {"timeout": DISPATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS}
```

The setting is read for every `run_agent` and `run_parallel` dispatch,
whatever spelling `agent` used (a path, a registered command name, a
channel name or `cron`): the dispatcher resolves the agent to its
script and reads that script's merged `settings()` before it waits.
The timeout has this one meaning everywhere — the seconds the call
blocks before returning the job id(s) — and never stops a child.  Not
a run parameter: it has no wire field, and a `/xxx text` command,
which runs the SEA directly in the tab's own run, has no dispatch
timer at all.

### Running a SEA: `run_agent`, `run_parallel` and `/xxx` commands

A running agent dispatches a SEA with the `run_agent` tool
(`agent_dispatch.make_run_agent_tool`), or several at once with
`run_parallel` (`agent_dispatch.make_run_parallel_tool`), which is
`run_agent` made once per task:

```text
run_agent(task, agent="", model="", tool_profile="", max_budget="", timeout="", options="", wait="")
run_parallel(tasks, agent="", model="", tool_profile="", max_budget="", timeout="", options="")
agent_job(job_id, action="tail", timeout_seconds="")
```

`task` is the sub-task's task text (the SEA's `prompt(task)`, if
defined, turns it into the prompt); `options` is a JSON object in the
`settings()` vocabulary (`agent_dispatch.OPTION_TYPES`: every settings
key except the ones that describe a script, `locked` and `hidden`
(`sea_settings.META_SETTINGS`), and except the
four the tool takes as arguments, plus `inherit`, `workspace`, `add_to_prompt`
and `add_to_system_prompt`, the caller's text appended to the prompt
and the system prompt); `model`, `tool_profile`, `max_budget` and
`timeout` (number strings) are arguments only, and `options` refuses
those keys with a message naming the argument.  Every value given is
explicit: it wins over the SEA's settings, or is refused when the SEA
locks the key.  Each option replaces the inherited value (and the
SEA's, unless locked) of one key: `work_dir` (relative to
the calling task's directory), `chat_id`, `workspace` (the account of
a multi-account channel; refused for any SEA that is not a channel),
`model_config`, `inherit`,
`use_worktree`, `auto_commit`, `auto_classify`, `use_web_tools`,
`use_memory`, `docker_image`, `add_to_prompt` and
`add_to_system_prompt`, e.g. `'{"use_web_tools": false}'`.  `wait="false"`
returns with a job id as soon as the sub-task's tab exists (its
initial `status running=true`, so the spawn lands inside the call's
time window on every surface), the dispatch has already failed (then
the error is the answer), or a 30 s start grace
(`agent_dispatch._JOB_START_GRACE_SECONDS`) has passed; the dispatch
runs in a daemon thread
of the calling process (`agent_dispatch.start_agent_job`), its spend
is bound to the calling run's usage epoch, and only the calling
agent's `agent_job` tool sees the job: `agent_job(job_id, "wait")`
blocks for its result, `"tail"` reports whether it still runs,
`"kill"` sets the job's cancel event, which `daemon_client.run`'s read
loop turns into a stop of the sub-task confirmed by its terminal
status (an unconfirmed stop is reported as such, never as "stopped").
`agent` names WHICH agent to run; every spelling resolves to one
SEA path and takes the same dispatch
(`agent_dispatch.resolve_agent` tries, in order):

1. empty, or a generic label a model may invent (`general`,
   `assistant`, `default`, ...; not `worker`, which is a base class, and
   not `reviewer`, which is refused with "pass `tool_profile="review"`"
   because a reviewer is a toolset, not an agent): the plain
   sub-agent, `seas/sorcar/sorcar_sea.py`;
2. a path (a `.py` suffix or a path separator): that SEA file, a
   relative path resolved against the calling task's work directory;
3. a registered slash-command name (case, spaces, hyphens and
   underscores are ignored, so "Home Assistant" is `homeassistant`):
   a bundled SEA (`write_paper`, `sh`), a channel
   (`third_party_agents/<name>/<name>_sea.py`), `cron`
   (`sea_commands.BUILTIN_COMMANDS`, the scheduled-automations agent
   `kiss.agents.sorcar.cron_agent`) or a `SEAS.md` folder: that
   command's script, located by path.  The calling process executes
   the script once, reads its class (a `ChannelSea` or not) and folds
   `settings()` over its class chain to read the effective settings
   (`sea_commands.sea_settings`: the `timeout`, `work_dir` and `locked`
   the dispatch needs); the run itself, with the prompt, system-prompt
   and tool methods, happens on the daemon.

Anything else returns `Error: unknown agent '...' — not a registered
slash command and not a path to a .py SEA file.` with the closest
command and the registered commands.  The sub-task is reported under
the resolved name: the command name, else the script's file stem
without `_sea`.

A `/xxx text` prompt typed into a chat tab is NOT a dispatch: the
daemon (`task_runner._run_task`, via `sea_commands.slash_command_task`)
runs the SEA `xxx` directly in the tab's own run, with `text` as the
prompt and the SEA's path as the run's `seaPath`, so the SEA's
settings, system prompt and tools apply to that very run; there is no
relay LLM turn and no nested sub-agent tab, and the raw `/xxx text`
line stays what the task panel and the chat history show
(`displayPrompt`).  `/xxx help` answers with `description()` without
running anything; `/xxx check` loads the class and answers with the
classes of its inheritance chain, effective settings, model,
the tools `tools()` adds, the methods it defines and the prompt for a
sample task, or the first error (`sea_commands.sea_check`).  A
model-picker SEA (`bestrouter`) selected on the
tab is applied before `/sh` under `/sh ...`: `/sh`'s own `seaPath`
stays, on the picker's model (`/sh` replaces the system prompt, so
the picker's routing protocol does not reach it; a SEA that appends
keeps it).

`run_parallel(tasks, ..., agent=...)` is N `run_agent` calls
(`agent_dispatch.run_agents_parallel`): one `start_run_agent` per
task with the same `agent`, arguments and `options`, so every child is
a daemon sub-task in its own tab, exactly what `run_agent` would
start, under the same precedence rule and the same inheritance table
(the caller's remaining budget is shared among the N children plus the
caller); its `prompt(task)` shapes each child's prompt, its
system-prompt texts, tools and hooks apply on the daemon.  Every
`options` key `run_agent` takes is accepted here too — `use_worktree`,
`auto_commit`, `auto_classify`, `chat_id`, `workspace` and a channel
SEA included — and `inherit: false` makes the children take nothing
from the caller, their budget included (each then gets the explicit
`max_budget`, else the SEA's, else the daemon default, exactly like a
`run_agent` child).  The call blocks for the one
`timeout` (argument > the SEA's setting > 3600) and returns a YAML
list with one entry per task: the child's result text or, for a child
still running at that point, its `agent_job` notice; no child is
stopped by the timeout.

### `system_prompt()`, `register_as_model()` and `on_picked_as_model()` — model routing SEAs

| Method                         | Return type | Effect                                                     |
|--------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `system_prompt(self, system_prompt)` | `str` | the run's system prompt; `system_prompt + "\n\n" + PROTOCOL` **adds** the protocol after what is already there |
| `register_as_model(self)`      | `bool`      | `True` lists the SEA in the model picker under its command name |
| `on_picked_as_model(self, work_dir)` | `str` | hook run once per run whose model is the SEA; the returned text is logged |

A model-routing SEA's `system_prompt()` carries its *model routing
protocol*: it appends the protocol to the system prompt it receives
(the base prompt plus the caller's `appendToSystemPrompt` text, or the
channel preamble), separated by a blank line.  Because it returns the
received text plus a suffix, the caller's own additions survive.  The
result is this run's prompt only: a sub-agent gets the protocol when
its own layers include the picker (a `/xxx` command typed into the
picker's tab, or a `run_agent` call that names the picker as its
`model`), not by inheritance: a child that inherits the tab's model
gets the real model the picker resolved to.
`register_as_model()` is a registry flag,
not a run parameter: `kiss.agents.sorcar.sea_commands.model_seas()`
lists every registered SEA whose `register_as_model()` returns `True`,
the daemon offers them in the model picker (vendor `Router`, once at
least one catalog model is runnable), and a task run with such a pick
becomes a run of the SEA on the model its
`settings()["model"]` names (else the default model) — `/xxx` slash
commands and runs that already carry an `seaPath` keep their agent,
with the picker's methods folded in first (see
[Extending a SEA](#extending-a-sea-python-inheritance)).  The bundled
`autorouter` and `bestrouter`
are such SEAs; `bestrouter` is three methods besides `description()`:

```python
class BestrouterSea(BaseSea):
    def register_as_model(self) -> bool:
        return True

    def system_prompt(self, system_prompt: str) -> str:
        return system_prompt + "\n\n" + SYSTEM_PROMPT  # the routing protocol

    def settings(self, settings: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return settings | {"model": PRIMARY_MODEL}
```

`on_picked_as_model(work_dir)` is the picked SEA's chance to act on
being chosen.  `kiss.agents.sorcar.sea_commands.run_picked_hook` runs it
on a daemon thread at two moments: when the user picks the SEA in the
model picker (`selectModel`, with the tab's registered work directory,
else the daemon's global one, without waiting), and once per run whose model is the SEA (after the
SEA overrides, with the run's effective work directory,
waiting at most `PICKED_HOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, 15 s, before the task
starts).  It is not a run parameter: the return value is only logged,
a hook that raises is logged as a warning, and one that blocks is
abandoned on its thread; none of them fails the run.  It does not run
for a `/xxx` command's agent or an explicit `seaPath`, only for the
SEA the model pick names.  `autorouter` uses it to make sure an
enabled weekly cron job that runs `/rsi7d autorouter` exists
(`autorouter_sea.schedule_weekly_rsi7d`: an enabled job of that name is
kept as is, a paused one is resumed, and when there is none one is
created — a prompt job in the KISS checkout the work directory
is in, with worktree and auto-commit, or a scratch-directory job that
still refreshes `$KISS_HOME/AUTOROUTER.md` when there is no checkout;
a linked task worktree resolves to its owning checkout).  Hooks from
concurrent picks may overlap — a SEA file is executed afresh on every
call and cannot hold a lock of its own — so the look-up-then-create is
the cron store's atomic `cron_job("ensure")`, not the SEA's.

The `run()` parameters without a `settings()` key (the allowlist is
`sea_settings.SETTING_TYPES`; naming one of these stops the task with
`settings() has an unknown key ...`):

- **`system_prompt`** — a replacement base system prompt the caller
  supplies (what `run_agent` forwards from the calling run's own
  replacement prompt); the SEA's `system_prompt()` method receives it,
  with the caller's `add_to_system_prompt` already appended, and
  returns the run's.  The method is the SEA's way to set the prompt;
  `settings()` has no key for it.
- **`timeout`** — bounds the *client's* local wait (`None` waits
  indefinitely; the default is 3600 s).  The daemon does not enforce
  it.  The wire field `timeout` carries `record_timeout` when one is
  given, else this value when `stop_on_timeout` is `True`, else
  nothing; a sent value is recorded in the task's `task_settings`, and
  it is checked against a SEA's locked `timeout` only when the call's
  `provenance` marks `timeout` explicit, which `run_agent` does for
  an explicit `timeout` argument (it sends that as `record_timeout`
  with `timeout=None`).  (The `timeout` KEY of `settings()` is a
  different thing: the dispatcher's wait for a `run_agent` sub-task,
  see above.)
- **`stop_on_timeout`** — whether a `timeout` expiry also stops the
  task, awaiting the stop's confirmation (default `False`: the task
  keeps running); a client-side choice the script must not override.
- **`record_timeout`** — a bound sent as the wire field `timeout` (so
  the daemon records it in the task's `task_settings` event and checks
  it against a SEA's locked `timeout`) when the client's own wait has
  none: `run_agent` waits without a deadline on a job thread and bounds
  the call by joining that thread, so it passes the call's bound here.
- **`cancel` / `running`** — two `threading.Event`s of the client's
  wait: setting `cancel` from another thread stops the task
  (`agent_job(id, "kill")`, or the calling run's end) and the wait
  continues until the task's terminal status confirms it is dead or
  the confirmation grace expires, then raises `CancelledError` with
  `confirmed` set accordingly; `running` is set when the task's
  initial `status running=true` arrives, the moment its tab exists on
  every surface, and not by a wait that ends without one; the
  `run_agent` job thread sets it itself once it has recorded the
  dispatch's outcome.  A background `run_agent` call waits for that
  signal for up to the 30 s start grace, then answers with the
  finished result when there is one and with a job notice otherwise
  (also when the grace expired before the tab existed).
- **`provenance`** — `{setting key: "explicit" | "inherited"}`, where
  each of the command's values came from (`kiss.agents.sorcar.run_config`);
  the dispatcher fills it from what the call passed and what it took
  from the calling agent, the daemon records it in the task's
  `task_settings` event, and the result's `ran:` line reads its
  `inherited=` list from there.
- **`endpoint_file`** — selects which daemon to connect to (default:
  `$KISS_SORCAR_LOCAL`, else `$KISS_HOME/sorcar-local.json`, the file the
  daemon writes with its WSS URL and per-start local token); the script
  already runs on that daemon.
- **`parent_task_id` / `parent_tab_id` / `parent_reviewer`** — the
  CALLING task's identity (how `run_agent` nests a dispatched run under
  its caller) and whether that caller sits in a reviewer sub-tree (a
  marker the child and its own sub-agents inherit; with tool profiles
  enabled, a marked run whose task is not an implementation task and
  that names no explicit profile gets the read-only `review` profile),
  which a dispatched script must not be able to forge.
- **`side_channel`** — marks the run as a side channel of its parent
  (a sub-agent whose result is shown outside its own tab: the `/ask`
  answerer delivers its answer into the PARENT's transcript, the
  periodic in-process `/ask` run of `kiss.server.task_update` fills the
  parent task's task-info panel, and the in-process `/merge` run that
  resolves a conflicting
  auto-merge works in the parent's repository; so its own tab closes
  when the run ends and is not re-opened when the chat is reloaded);
  only
  meaningful with `parent_task_id`, and not forgeable for the same
  reason.
- **`sea_path`** — the script cannot override its own path.
- **`scope_work_dir`** — the calling task's directory, sent as
  `tabScopeWorkDir`: `run_agent` fills it from the caller, and it is
  the directory a relative `work_dir` (the SEA's setting or the call's
  option) is anchored at and compared against a locked `work_dir`
  (`sea_apply.calling_work_dir`; the command's own `workDir` when it
  is absent, as for a `/<name>` run).  It is also recorded on the
  run's tab in the daemon's shared tab registry.
- **`inherit_tools`** — whether the run also gets the extra tools of
  the task `parent_task_id` names (the callables that parent's SEA
  kept or added beyond the built-ins in its `tools()`, and those the
  parent inherited itself), appended to the built-in toolset under
  names it does not have yet before the run's own `tools()` sees the
  list; a run on the `none` profile keeps exactly what its `tools()`
  returns.  `run_agent` sets it for every inheriting dispatch (not a
  channel, no `inherit: false` option), so a sub-task that inherits the caller's system
  prompt also has the tools that prompt refers to; a script decides
  nothing here.
- **`workspace`** — the multi-account channel workspace a
  `ChannelSea` run holds for its lifetime (see
  [Channels](#channels-class-xseachannelsea)); the `run_agent` option
  `workspace` or a channel launcher supplies it, every other run
  ignores it.
- **`add_to_system_prompt` / `add_to_prompt`** — the caller's
  additions; the SEA's `system_prompt()` receives the system prompt
  with the caller's suffix already in it, and the caller's
  `add_to_prompt` is appended after what `prompt(task)` returned.

### Setting semantics

- **`None` and `""`** — a key whose value is `None` is dropped like an
  absent key (`sea_settings.resolve_settings`); so is a string key
  (`work_dir`, `model`, `chat_id`, `tool_profile`,
  `docker_image`) whose value is `""`, exactly as a blank `run_agent`
  option is.  Either means "no override": the caller's or the
  persisted value stands — also when the key is one a base class lays
  (a `WorkerSea` subclass returning `settings | {"use_memory": None}`
  drops the worker default; leave the key out to keep it).
- **`model`** — leave the key out (or write `""` / `None`) to keep the
  caller's model (the tab's pick, or the calling task's model for a
  `run_agent` dispatch); a run whose command names no model at all gets
  the tab's selected model, else the daemon's configured default
  (`task_runner._tab_model`).  A non-empty string must name a model in
  the daemon's available model list or the task fails, unless the
  effective `model_config` has a `base_url` and the name is one the
  bundled catalog or `$KISS_HOME/MY_MODELS.json` knows (so it can be
  priced): such an endpoint run skips the availability check.
- **`chat_id`** — a non-empty string resumes that chat session.  A
  fresh chat comes from not inheriting one (a channel run, a
  `run_agent` call with `inherit: false`), not from `chat_id: ""`,
  which is dropped like every empty string.
- **`system_prompt(system_prompt)`** — the method that receives the
  assembled system prompt and returns the run's (`/sh`, `/merge`,
  `/ask` replace it, `bestrouter` and `/write` append to it; it is not
  a settings key).  Without it the prompt is the daemon's: with task
  classification enabled (the default) a task classified as
  simple runs on the reduced `SYSTEM_LITE.md`, everything else on the
  full `SYSTEM.md`.  Both files are loaded with their `{{IDENTITY}}`
  brand placeholder filled in (`kiss.core.brand.render_brand`); the
  string `system_prompt()` returns is used verbatim, with no
  placeholder rendering.  Either way the agent still appends its
  per-run operational instructions after the prompt
  (`RelentlessAgent.perform_task`): the work directory (omitted when
  the tools run in an attached container that does not mount it), the
  process id, the task settings, and the user's standing instructions
  from `$KISS_HOME/AGENTS.md` (the file the
  bundled `/remember` and `/forget` SEAs maintain) when that file
  exists.  A `model_config["system_instruction"]` value, if present,
  takes precedence over the composed prompt (`KISSAgent.run` only
  `setdefault`s it).
- **`prompt(task)`** — the method that turns the task text into the
  prompt body (`/merge` wraps the user's text with the standing merge
  instructions; the coding harness ignores the runner's label and
  uses its config's instruction).  It must return a non-empty string.
  Without it the task text is the prompt.
- **`{task_id}` in `prompt(task)`** — every `{task_id}` of the final
  prompt, written by a `prompt()` method or present in the task text
  itself, is replaced by the calling task's
  id (the command's `parentTaskId`; the empty string when the run has
  no parent), which is how `/ask` names the task a question is about:

  ```python
  def prompt(self, task: str) -> str:
      return task + "\n\n" + (
          "The question above is about the task with id {task_id}. "
          "Call task_context with that task id, then answer the question."
      )
  ```

  A run with a SEA executes its prompt as one task: the
  task runner does not split `<task>` blocks into subtasks for an
  `seaPath` run (they are the SEA's to interpret), so the text is
  appended once.  A prompt that is nothing but a filesystem path is
  likewise handed to the SEA as-is rather than turned into an "open
  this file" request, as it is for a path typed into a chat box.  The
  shaped prompt becomes the recorded prompt in chat history, except
  for a `/xxx text` run, whose history keeps the `/xxx text` line the
  user typed.
- **`use_web_tools`** — per-run browser-tool enablement.  `None`
  falls back to the daemon's configured default (the settings panel's
  "Use web tools" checkbox, persisted as `use_web_browser`).  Under
  the daemon the browser tools include `show_browser()`, which moves
  the page the agent is browsing into the Browser tab on every surface
  (the daemon's `BrowserTabService`, passed to the run as
  `live_browser` and forwarded to its sub-agents) so the user can
  watch and act on it; there is no setting for it.
- **`auto_classify`** — per-run pre-run task classification.
  `None` falls back to the daemon's configured default (the settings
  panel's "Classify tasks before running" checkbox, persisted as
  `classify_tasks`; `task_classifier.classification_enabled`).
- **`use_memory`** — per-run persistent agent memory
  (`kiss.core.memoryfield`): the seven `memory_*` tools plus the
  memory protocol prompt block.  `True` enables, `False` disables,
  `None` falls back to the daemon's configured default (the settings
  panel's "Use persistent memory" checkbox, persisted as
  `use_memory`, or the daemon process's `KISS_USE_MEMORY` environment
  variable).  The override is inherited by `run_agent` / `run_parallel`
  sub-tasks and never bypasses the memory safety gates: a run without the basic
  toolset, a Docker run, a run-to-completion CLI model (`cc/*`,
  `codex/*`), or a caller-supplied
  `model_config["system_instruction"]` stays memory-free even with
  `True`.  Pages live in the directory named by the `memory_dir`
  setting, or `$KISS_HOME/memories` when unset;
  a run whose work directory is inside a git repository also attaches
  that repository's domain memory, a sub-directory named after the
  repository's main checkout directory (linked worktrees resolve to it
  through `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, so they share one domain;
  `sorcar_agent._memory_settings`, `_repo_memory_domains`).
- **`use_worktree`** — whether the run executes in a fresh git
  worktree on its own branch (when `work_dir` is inside a git
  repository; the daemon may hand it a spare worktree it prepared in
  advance) instead of the main working tree.  With task classification
  enabled, a task not classified as development work also runs
  without a worktree when its `True` is an inherited or persisted
  default; a `True` a SEA pins or a call passes explicitly is a
  decision the classifier keeps, and the verdict only ever demotes a
  `True`, so `False` stays `False`.
- **`auto_commit`** — whether the run's changes are committed when
  it finishes successfully.  A worktree run's branch is committed and
  squash-merged into the original branch (a conflicting merge is
  handed to the bundled `/merge` SEA, which resolves and stages the
  conflicted files, and the resolver then commits); a main-tree run's
  changes are committed in place.  A run that failed, was stopped, or
  reported `success: False` is not auto-committed, and `False` leaves
  a worktree run pending for the user to review, merge or discard.
  The commit message is generated from the diff and stamped with the
  user's prompt and the task's result (HTML converted to Markdown,
  `kiss.agents.sorcar.commit_message`).  A merge into the main tree
  waits while another non-worktree task is active there and
  `git status --porcelain -uno` reports uncommitted changes to tracked
  files, whoever made them (an unreadable status blocks too); untracked
  scratch files alone do not block it
  (`merge_flow._main_tree_blocks_merge`).
- **`tool_profile`** — the name of the tool profile the run's
  built-in toolset is cut down to: `"full"` (everything), `"review"`
  (the `shell` and `browser` groups, the four read-only memory tools
  `memory_search`, `memory_pull`, `memory_read` and `memory_list`,
  `decide`, `summary` and `talk`; no editing, memory writing or
  dispatch), `"assistant"`
  (the `shell` group plus `ask_user_question`, `talk`, `decide`,
  `summary`, `set_model`), `"bash"` (`Bash` only — the bundled `/sh`
  agent's choice), or a tool group: `"shell"` (`Bash`, `bash_job`,
  `Read`, `run_commands_parallel`), `"edit"` (`Edit`, `Write`),
  `"browser"`, `"memory"`, `"agents"` (`run_agent`, `agent_job`,
  `run_parallel`, `number_of_cores`), `"mcp"` (the configured servers' tools and the
  sign-in pair), `"skills"`, `"user"` (`ask_user_question`, `talk`),
  `"decide"`, `"control"` (`summary`, `set_model`).  Join several with
  `+` to keep the union of their tools (`"shell+edit+memory"`);
  `finish` is always added.  `"none"` builds no built-in toolset at
  all: the run's tools are `finish` and whatever `tools([])`
  returns (the bundled `/ask` agent's choice, so its only tools are
  `task_context` and `finish`).  `""` keeps the daemon's usual choice.
  An unknown name fails the task when it starts.
- **`docker_image`** — the Docker image the run's shell and file
  tools (`Bash`, `run_commands_parallel`, `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`)
  execute in: an image name starts a fresh container that is removed
  when the task ends (the task's `work_dir` is bind-mounted at the
  same path and is the container's working directory),
  `container:<name-or-id>` attaches to a container the caller already
  runs (commands run in its own working directory, nothing extra is
  mounted, it is left running afterwards), `""` runs the tools on the
  host.
  `run_agent` / `run_parallel` sub-tasks share the task's container
  (`container:<id>`); `bash_job`
  and persistent memory are unavailable in a Docker run.  A
  run-to-completion CLI model (`cc/*`, `codex/*`) executes its own
  tools on the host, so a non-empty `docker_image` with such a
  model fails the task with a `KISSError` instead of silently
  bypassing the container.  The bundled `seas/coding/coding_sea.py`'s
  `ContainerHarness` is the reference user of the attach form: its
  `settings()` returns `docker_image: "container:<id>"` for the trial
  container it is given, and the generated per-trial SEAs merge that
  dict into their own `settings()`.

### Call hooks (no `run()` parameter)

The class may also define two per-call hooks with no corresponding
`sorcar.run()` parameter or `settings()` key — a callable cannot be
JSON-serialized, so the hooks exist ONLY as SEA methods, called in
the daemon process (`sea_apply.DAEMON_SIDE_FIELDS` names the staged
command fields that carry them, together with `systemPromptHook` and
`toolsHook`):

| Method                                 | Returns      | Staged command field |
|----------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| `llm_call_hook(self, new_messages)`    | `list`       | `llmCallHook`        |
| `tool_call_hook(self, name, args)`     | `Verdict`    | `toolCallHook`       |

The hooks are passed to the underlying `KISSAgent.run()` of every
task-executor sub-session of the task's agent (internal helper
sessions, e.g. the failed-session trajectory summarizer, are not
hooked; a `run_agent` / `run_parallel` child gets the hooks of its own
layers — the `agent` the call names, or the hidden `sorcar` SEA when it
names none — not the parent's).
Per `KISSAgent.run()`'s contract:

- **`llm_call_hook(new_messages)`** — called before every LLM call
  with the list of new messages (those added to the conversation
  since the previous LLM call) about to be sent; its return value
  replaces those messages.  The `BaseSea` default returns them unchanged.
- **`tool_call_hook(name, args)`** — called before every tool call
  with the tool's name and arguments dict and returns a typed verdict
  (`kiss.core.tool_verdict.Verdict`, re-exported by `base_sea`):
  `ALLOW` lets the tool execute; `refuse(text)` suppresses the call
  and *text* is given to the model as the tool's result.  The
  `BaseSea` default returns `ALLOW`.  A literal `None` or string (the
  allow / refuse spellings of older hooks) is the `verdict` finding of
  `uv run sea lint`, and `--fix` rewrites it.

A hook that returns the wrong type (a non-list, a non-`Verdict`)
fails the task with a diagnostic error, like every wrong-typed value.
In an inheritance chain the `llm_call_hook` results are threaded base
first, and the first `tool_call_hook` refusal wins.

```python
# guarded_agent.py
from typing import Any

from kiss.agents.seas.base.base_sea import ALLOW, BaseSea, Verdict, refuse


class GuardedSea(BaseSea):
    def tool_call_hook(self, name: str, args: dict[str, Any]) -> Verdict:
        if name == "Bash" and "rm -rf" in str(args.get("command", "")):
            return refuse("Blocked: destructive command")
        return ALLOW
```

### Only `settings()` configures a run

The dispatcher and the task runner evaluate `settings()` alone when
they need a script's timeout, model or work directory before
the run exists (`sea_commands.sea_settings`), so `settings()` must be
cheap and side-effect-free there.  `prompt(task)` runs inside
`apply_sea`, once per run; `system_prompt()` and `tools()`
run once when the agent starts, the two call hooks on every LLM and
tool call.  A method named differently from the contract
(`def use_worktree(self)`, `def add_to_tools(self)`, ...) is an
ordinary method the daemon never calls; `uv run sea lint` does not
flag such a definition, only a docstring that still describes the
earlier contract's getters (`stale-docstring`), so check the method
names yourself.


## Tools: `tools(tools)`

An SEA supplies tools to the LLM agent through one method,
`tools(self, tools)`, which receives the run's toolset so far (a copy
of the built-in toolset of the run's tool profile plus the tools
inherited from the calling task) and returns the **list of callables**
the run gets (a file path is not accepted).  There is no other way to
give the agent extra tools: `sorcar.run()` has no tools parameter,
because a callable cannot travel the wire.

- `return tools + [mine]` **adds** to the built-in toolset (`Bash`,
  `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, browser tools, ...), or to the tool profile
  the SEA's `tool_profile` setting selects; the method may also drop
  or replace entries.
- With `"tool_profile": "none"` the method receives `[]` and what it
  returns plus `finish` is the agent's **entire** tool set; the
  built-in toolset is not built.  Pair it with a `system_prompt()`
  written for those tools.

The daemon calls `tools()` once, when the agent starts, and hands the
returned callables to the agent; whatever the list holds beyond the
built-ins is the run's extra toolset, which its own `run_agent`
sub-tasks inherit.  A single file provides both settings and tools.
The file is re-executed from source on every run (no `__pycache__`),
so keep module-level side effects cheap or idempotent.

```python
# self_contained_agent.py
from typing import Any

from kiss.agents.seas.base.base_sea import BaseSea


def double(n: int) -> int:
    """Double a number.

    Args:
        n: The number to double.
    """
    return n * 2


class DoubleSea(BaseSea):
    def prompt(self, task: str) -> str:
        return "Double the number 21."

    def tools(self, tools: list[Any]) -> list[Any]:
        return tools + [double]  # built-in toolset + double
```

### Tool function requirements

Each tool function must:

1. Have a **name** — the function name becomes the tool name the LLM
   sees.  The run keeps one tool per name, the later entry of the list
   `tools()` returns winning, so a tool named like a built-in (`Bash`,
   `Read`) silently replaces it and two of your own with one name
   leave only the second; `finish` is added by the run itself.  Use
   distinct names unless replacing a built-in is the intent.
2. Have a **docstring** with a Google-style `Args:` section describing
   each parameter.
3. Use **type-annotated, keyword-bindable parameters** — the daemon
   builds the tool schema from the annotations.
4. Be **callable** — the daemon calls `callable(tool)` on each entry.

```python
def search_database(query: str, max_results: int = 10) -> str:
    """Search the internal database.

    Args:
        query: The search query string.
        max_results: Maximum number of results to return.
    """
    # implementation
    return results
```


## The built-in toolset

By default — no `tool_profile` setting, with or without a `tools()`
method — the agent gets `finish` (always present) and the
built-in KISS Sorcar toolset — `Bash` (with
`background=True` for detached jobs), `bash_job` (wait for / tail /
kill a background job), `run_commands_parallel` (several shell
commands at once, no LLM sub-agents), `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`,
`ask_user_question`, `talk`, `set_model`, `summary`, `run_agent`,
`run_parallel`, `number_of_cores`,
browser tools (when `use_web_tools`), `decide` (when
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is configured), the `memory_*` tools (when
memory is enabled), and any configured skill and MCP-server tools —
**plus** your extension tools.  A restricted tool profile (a reviewer
sub-agent dispatched with `run_parallel(..., tool_profile="review")`)
filters that built-in set, including the memory tools; extension tools
are still appended.

With `"tool_profile": "none"` the agent's **only** tools are `finish`
and the tools `tools([])` returned; the built-in toolset is not
built, so `use_web_tools` has nothing to act on,
and a `run_agent` caller's extra tools are not merged in either.
This is useful for building focused, restricted agents (`/ask`).  A
SEA that wants the built-in toolset plus its own tools leaves
`tool_profile` alone (or picks a narrower profile such as `"bash"`,
as `/remember` does).

When restricting tools, the full default system prompt (`SYSTEM.md`)
assumes the full toolset (its workflow rules name `Read`, `Edit`,
`Bash` and the browser tools).  Return a `system_prompt()` that
matches the tools you provide:

```python
class WeatherSea(WorkerSea):
    def settings(self, settings: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return settings | {"tool_profile": "none"}

    def tools(self, tools: list[Any]) -> list[Any]:
        return [get_weather]  # the whole tool set: get_weather + finish

    def system_prompt(self, system_prompt: str) -> str:
        return (
            "You are a weather assistant. Use the get_weather tool "
            "to look up weather, then call finish with the result."
        )
```


## Error handling

Errors fall into two categories depending on where they are caught:

**Client-side errors** (raised as `ValueError` before connecting to
the daemon):
- `prompt` is empty or blank
- `sea_path` is neither `None`/`""` nor a string
- The SEA path is not a `.py` file
- The SEA file does not exist

**Daemon-side errors** (the task starts, then fails with
`result.success == False` and the diagnostic in `result.text`, which
prefixes the message below with `Task failed: SeaError: `):

| Condition | `SeaError` message |
|-----------|---------------|
| File deleted between client validation and daemon import | `SEA '...' is not an existing Python (.py) file` |
| File raises at import time | `SEA '...' failed to import: ...` |
| No or several `BaseSea` subclasses defined in the file | `SEA '...' must define exactly one subclass of BaseSea (kiss.agents.seas.base.base_sea); found none` / `...; found OneSea, TwoSea` |
| The class cannot be instantiated without arguments | `SEA '...': MySea() raised: ...` |
| `settings()` returns something other than a dict | `settings() of SEA '...' must return a dict, got ...` |
| unknown key | `SEA '...': settings() has an unknown key 'x'; known keys: work_dir, model, chat_id, ...` |
| renamed key | `SEA '...': settings() key 'classify_tasks' was renamed to 'auto_classify'; run `uv run sea lint --fix` to rewrite the script` |
| removed key (`kind`, `preset`, `channel`) | `SEA '...': settings() key 'kind' was removed: what a SEA is became its base class: derive from `WorkerSea` (a tool-bound run on the caller's tree) or `ChannelSea` (an external-service agent) instead of `BaseSea` ...; run `uv run sea lint --fix` to rewrite the script` |
| removed key (`allow_fan_out`, `is_parallel`) | `SEA '...': settings() key 'allow_fan_out' was removed: `run_parallel` is N `run_agent` calls, so there is nothing to allow or forbid separately; `tool_profile` chooses the toolset` |
| wrong-typed value (`bool` for a number, `int` for a `str`, ...) | `SEA '...': settings()['max_budget'] must be int or float, got bool` |
| non-finite `max_budget` / `timeout` | `SEA '...': settings()['max_budget'] must return a finite number or None` |
| `prompt()` returns an empty string | `prompt() of SEA '...' must return a non-empty string` |
| a method `X` raises | `X() of SEA '...' raised: ...` |
| a method returns the wrong type | `system_prompt() of SEA '...' must return a string, got ...`, `tools() of SEA '...' must return a list of tool callables (not a file path), got ...`, `llm_call_hook() of SEA '...' must return a list, got ...`, `tool_call_hook() of SEA '...' must return a Verdict (ALLOW, or refuse(text), from kiss.agents.seas.base.base_sea), got ...` |
| a value whose own methods raise (e.g. a `str` subclass with a raising `__str__`) | `prompt() of SEA '...' returned a broken value: ...`, `SEA '...': settings()['max_budget'] returned a broken value: ...` |
| a `sea_class(spec)` base that does not exist | `sea_class('x'): not a registered SEA command; known commands: ...`, `sea_class('x.py'): not an existing Python (.py) file` (raised while the file executes, so reported as an import failure) |

Overrides are **atomic**: if loading the class, `settings()` or
`prompt()` fails, the command keeps all its original values (no
partial overrides).  `system_prompt()`, `tools()` and the two call
hooks run later, inside the agent (once at start, or per call): a
failure there raises the same `SeaError` message, which ends the
task as a failed result (`success == False`) after the overrides
have been applied.  The wrapper around the message depends on the
stage: `Task failed: SeaError: ...` is the setup stage's
(`task_runner`), while a per-call hook failure is caught by the
executor and reported as `SeaError: ...` in the result text.


## Continuing chat sessions

Pass `chat_id` to continue an existing daemon chat session.  The agent
receives the chat's retained top-level context as a prefix, not
necessarily every prior row: sub-agent rows are excluded, a history
longer than ten entries keeps the first two and the latest eight, and
with the default history digest older entries are shortened and only the
newest two task/result pairs stay whole while the prefix fits in 6,000
characters (an oversized history drops older entries first, then digests
the newest ones too, then hard-truncates).

```python
result1 = sorcar.run(
    "Analyze the codebase",
    sea_path="my_agent.py",
)

# Continue the same chat
result2 = sorcar.run(
    "Now fix the issues you found",
    chat_id=result1.chat_id,
    sea_path="my_agent.py",
)
```

An SEA can also force a specific chat via `settings()["chat_id"]`.


## Model configuration

Use the `model_config` setting to pass custom endpoint URLs, headers,
or sampling parameters:

```python
class LocalModelSea(BaseSea):
    def settings(self, settings: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return settings | {
            "model": "my-custom-model",
            "model_config": {
                "base_url": "http://localhost:8080/v1",
                "api_key": "sk-local-key",
            },
        }
```

When `model_config` contains a `base_url`, the model factory bypasses
its normal provider routing and creates an OpenAI-compatible model
pointing at that URL.  The daemon's model preflight then only asks
that `model` be a name the bundled catalog or `$KISS_HOME/MY_MODELS.json`
knows (`model_info.is_known_model`, so the run can be priced); the
provider's own API key or CLI executable is not required for such an
endpoint run.  Without a `base_url`, `model` must be in the daemon's
available model list (an API key for HTTP providers, the executable
on `PATH` for `cc/*` / `codex/*`).  So replace `my-custom-model` above
with a catalogued or `MY_MODELS.json` name; otherwise the task fails
with `No model available.  Set at least one API key in the
environment.`


## Complete working example

Below is a self-contained SEA that gives the LLM tools for
managing a SQLite task database.  Its `tools()` adds the database
tools to the built-in toolset, so the LLM can also use `Bash`, `Read`,
`Write`, etc. alongside them.

It defines no `prompt(task)` and its `settings()` names no `model`,
so the caller's prompt reaches the LLM and the caller's model (the
tab's pick, or the daemon's configured default) is used.

```python
# task_manager/task_manager_sea.py
"""SEA for managing a SQLite task database.

Gives the LLM three tools — add_task, list_tasks, complete_task — and
a system prompt explaining how to use them.  The agent runs with the
full KISS Sorcar toolset so it can also read files, run commands, etc.

## Tips

- The client-side `prompt` argument must be **non-empty** even when
  the SEA's `prompt(task)` rewrites it; the client validates before
  connecting.
- `settings()` **may name any subset** of the keys, or be left out
  altogether.  Only pin the ones whose defaults you want to change;
  `WorkerSea` covers the common bundle.
- Omit the `model` key to keep the caller's model (the tab's pick, or
  the daemon's configured default) rather than hard-coding one.
- Extra tools come only from the `tools(tools)` method, returning a
  **list of callables**; `tools + [yours]` (the built-in toolset plus
  yours) is the most common pattern, `"tool_profile": "none"` gives
  an exact tool set.
- The SEA is **re-imported from source** on every run.
  Edits take effect immediately without restarting the daemon.
- `max_budget` and `timeout` must be **finite** numbers.  `NaN`,
  `±inf`, or an overflowing value raises `SeaError`.
- The file must define **exactly one** subclass of `BaseSea` of its
  own; an imported base class (`from ...sh_sea import ShSea`) does not
  count, and helper classes that do not derive from `BaseSea` are
  free.  A method is applied only when the class (or a base) defines
  it, so leave out what you do not change rather than returning the
  argument unchanged; never call `super()` in a chained method
  (`settings`, `prompt`, `system_prompt`, `tools`, the two hooks), the
  launcher already ran the base's version (`description()`,
  `register_as_model()` and `on_picked_as_model()` are ordinary Python
  inheritance, where `super()` is fine).  Module-level constants
  (`SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `DISPATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) and functions are
  ordinary Python: the daemon reads only the class.
- The SEA and its tools run **in the daemon process**
  with the daemon user's privileges and environment.  Any libraries
  your code imports must be installed in the daemon's Python
  environment.  A tool that runs on the task's worker thread can call
  `kiss.server.agent_state.current_agent()` to get the running agent
  (its `work_dir`, model and usage counters); it returns `None` on any
  other thread.  The bundled `seas/autorouter/autorouter_sea.py`,
  `seas/rsi7d/rsi7d_sea.py` and `seas/skillopt/skillopt_sea.py` use it.
- Put the SEA in a folder named after the command, `xxx/xxx_sea.py`,
  and list that folder's parent in `$KISS_HOME/SEAS.md` (one folder per
  line; blank lines and `#` comments are ignored) to expose it as the
  chat command `/xxx`; `/xxx some text` runs the SEA on "some text"
  directly in the tab's run, and `/xxx help` prints its
  `description()` without running it.  The same name also works as
  `run_agent(agent="xxx", ...)`.  The command is the folder name, so it must match
  `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`; a loose `xxx_sea.py` placed directly in a listed
  folder is not a command.  Bundled
  `src/kiss/agents/third_party_agents/<name>/<name>_sea.py` scripts take
  precedence over `SEAS.md` folders, later `SEAS.md` lines beat
  earlier ones, the bundled Sorcar-extending SEAs in
  `src/kiss/agents/seas/` come next, so a `SEAS.md` folder can shadow
  them, and the built-in `cron` (`sea_commands.BUILTIN_COMMANDS`) has
  the lowest precedence of all.  Of the 17 bundled SEA folders, 15 register
  a command and two (`coding`, `sorcar`) are hidden: `/ask` (answers a question about the current task
  in two or three sentences from one `task_context` call over its
  status, spend, progress log and digested persisted events; its only
  tools are `task_context` and `finish`, so it never touches the task's
  files or shell; typed into a running task's
  tab it runs as a side channel that always dispatches the bundled
  `seas/ask/ask_sea.py`, even when a `SEAS.md` folder shadows the
  command, and the task-info panel's Task update is the same agent
  run in-process by `kiss.server.task_update`), `/autorouter` (runs a task on the cheapest model tier
  that will finish it), `/bestrouter` (runs a task on
  `claude-fable-5-1` and has `gpt-6-astra` review it), the hidden
  `coding` SEA (unattended coding in a Docker container for benchmark
  trials; its `settings()` is `{"hidden": True}`, so there is no
  `/coding` command: the trial runners load the generated per-trial
  SEAs, which expose its `ContainerHarness` methods, by path), `/forget`
  (removes a standing instruction from `$KISS_HOME/AGENTS.md`),
  `/git_extract_knowledge` (builds and refreshes a repository's
  knowledge memory and can schedule its daily refresh), `/merge`
  (resolves git merge conflicts and stages the resolved files; commits
  only when asked), `/remember` (appends a standing instruction to
  `$KISS_HOME/AGENTS.md`), `/review_paper` (reviews a research paper for
  a venue, scoring seven dimensions from 1 to 10), `/revise_and_review_paper` (writes a paper with
  `/write_paper`, has `/review_paper` review it fresh, and repeats until
  strong accept or no further improvement; task text carries `Writing:`
  and `Review:` instructions), `/rsi7d` (7-day self-improvement of the
  indexed SEAs from their recorded runs; the task text starts with the
  scope: `/rsi7d all`, `/rsi7d <name> [<name> ...]` for those SEAs only,
  or `/rsi7d --seas-dir <folder> [<name> ...]` for the SEAs of that
  folder, which then are the ones it may edit), `/sh`
  (runs the command with the `bash` tool profile), `/skillopt`
  (optimizes the prompt text of a skill or SEA against an eval set),
  `/task_update` (reports what a running task has done so far),
  `/write` (writes prose for a general audience in concise, professional
  American English that reads as human-written; it defines only
  `description()`, a `system_prompt()` that appends its style guide
  and a `settings()` of `{"timeout": 3600.0}`), `/write_paper` (writes
  or revises a research paper), and the plain sub-agent
  (`seas/sorcar/sorcar_sea.py`, a hidden SEA whose settings are
  `{"hidden": True}`, is what `run_agent` runs when its `agent` argument
  is empty or a generic label).  The other modules in that package
  (`coding/coding_test_context.py`,
  `git_extract_knowledge/git_knowledge_index.py`,
  `git_extract_knowledge/git_knowledge_store.py`, `rsi7d/sea_tuning.py`,
  the shared `agents_md.py`) are helpers, not commands: only
  `<name>/<name>_sea.py` folders are registered.  Syntax,
  precedence and the dispatch flow are
  documented in
  [docs/sea-commands.md](https://kisssorcar.github.io/docs/sea-commands.md)
  (source: `website/kisssorcar.github.io/docs/sea-commands.md`).
- A `/xxx text` command has no outer relay run: the tab's run IS the
  SEA run (`seaPath` set to the SEA, `text` as the prompt), with the
  tab's model, budget, chat and settings as the caller's values and
  the SEA's `settings()` on top of them, exactly as for a `run_agent`
  dispatch (see [Precedence](#precedence)).  The SEA is loaded by the
  same `apply_sea` as any `seaPath` run, so a broken
  script fails the run with an `SeaError` before the agent
  starts.
